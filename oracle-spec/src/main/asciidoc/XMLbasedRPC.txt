Introduction

image:jaxrpc-4.gif[image]

[#50634753_pgfId-997791]##The RPC (Remote Procedure Call) mechanism
enables a remote procedure call from a client to be communicated to a
remote server. An example use of an RPC mechanism is in a distributed
client/server model. A server defines a service as a collection of
procedures that are callable by remote clients. A client calls
procedures to access service defined by the server.

[#50634753_pgfId-997799]##In XML based RPC, a remote procedure call is
represented using an XML based protocol. SOAP 1.1 specification
link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_71367[See J2EE Specifications:
http://java.sun.com/j2ee/] defines an XML based protocol for exchange of
information in a decentralized, distributed environment. SOAP defines a
convention for representation of remote procedure calls and responses.
This is in addition to the definition of the SOAP envelope and encoding
rules.

[#50634753_pgfId-997881]##An XML based RPC server application can
define, describe and export a web service as an RPC based service. WSDL
(Web Service Description Language) link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_91453[See
Web Services Description Language (WSDL) 1.1: http://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl]
specifies an XML format for describing a service as a set of endpoints
operating on messages. An abstract description of such service can be
bound to an XML based protocol and underlying transport. A service
client can use an RPC based service.

[#50634753_pgfId-997820]##This document specifies Java APIs for XML
based RPC (JAX-RPC). This document is the formal specification for
JSR-101 [ _http://jcp.org/jsr/detail/101.jsp_ ], which is being worked
on under the Java Community Process [ _http://jcp.org_ ].

==== [#50634753_pgfId-997774]##

Design Goals

[#50634753_pgfId-997755]##The goals of this JSR are as follows:

[#50634753_pgfId-997743]##Specify APIs for supporting XML based RPC for
the Java platform

[#50634753_pgfId-1087945]##Define base level protocol bindings and to
not limit other protocol bindings that can be supported with the JAX-RPC
programming model.

[#50634753_pgfId-997750]##Define APIs that are simple to use for
development of Java applications that define or use JAX-RPC based
services. Simplicity of JAX-RPC APIs is an important element in making
the JAX-RPC model easy to understand, implement, maintain and evolve.
Part of the simplicity goal will be to follow the standard Java
application programming model and concepts as part of the JAX-RPC API
specification.

[#50634753_pgfId-997872]##Support interoperability across heterogeneous
platforms and environments. This specification will specify requirements
for interoperability as applied to the scope of JAX-RPC.

[#50634753_pgfId-997948]##Specify conformance and interoperability
requirements that are testable for an implementation of the JAX-RPC
specification.

{empty}[#50634753_pgfId-998682]##Keep the design of JAX-RPC APIs and
mechanisms extensible and modular. This will enable support for future
versions of various XML specifications, including XMLP
link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_65269[See W3C: SOAP 1.2:
http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/CR-soap12-part1-20021219/ and
http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/CR-soap12-part2-20021219/]

===== [#50634753_pgfId-997977]##Expert Group Goals

[#50634753_pgfId-1001123]##The goals of simplicity and faster time to
market imply that some important features are considered out of scope
for the 1.1 version of JAX-RPC specification. However, the JAX-RPC 1.1
specification recognizes that these out of scope features may be
implemented by a JAX-RPC implementation.

[#50634753_pgfId-1001142]##Proposed out of scope features for the 1.1
version of the JAX-RPC specification include:

[#50634753_pgfId-1001143]##Design of portable stubs and skeletons

[#50634753_pgfId-1001147]##Standard representation of transaction and
security context

[#50634753_pgfId-1041891]##Service registration and discovery

[#50634753_pgfId-1015456]##Objects by reference

[#50634753_pgfId-1001153]##These features may be addressed by future
versions of the JAX-RPC specification.

Stock Quote Service

[#50634753_pgfId-998054]##The following description uses a stock quote
service example to illustrate JAX-RPC concepts. Note that this use case
is used throughout this document to show use cases for the JAX-RPC APIs.

[#50634753_pgfId-1091175]##Note that this usecase describes a high level
overview of the JAX-RPC concepts. For more complete details, refer to
the detailed specification later in this document.

[#50634753_pgfId-998409]##The following diagram shows a server side
service endpoint definition of a stock quote service.

image:jaxrpc-6.gif[image]

===== [#50634753_pgfId-998084]##Service Endpoint Definition

[#50634753_pgfId-998571]##The example stock quote service is defined and
deployed using the Java platform. This service is capable of use by
service clients deployed on any platform. JAX-RPC service endpoint
definition makes no assumption that the service be only used by a Java
based service client. The converse also holds. A Java service client is
capable of using an XML based RPC service deployed on any non Java
platform.

[#50634753_pgfId-998588]##The example stock quote service endpoint
defines and implements the following Java interface.

======= [#50634753_pgfId-1015503]##[#50634753_73614]##An example service endpoint interface

[#50634753_pgfId-1015506]##package com.example;

[#50634753_pgfId-998101]##public interface StockQuoteProvider extends
java.rmi.Remote \{

[#50634753_pgfId-998105]## float getLastTradePrice (String tickerSymbol)

[#50634753_pgfId-998106]## throws java.rmi.RemoteException;

[#50634753_pgfId-998107]## // ...

[#50634753_pgfId-998103]##}

[#50634753_pgfId-998380]##In this example, stock quote service endpoint
definition starts with a Java interface as shown in the above code
example. This interface is called a service endpoint interface. Note
that the service developer could have started from the stock quote
service description in a WSDL document and mapped it to the
corresponding Java service endpoint interface.

[#50634753_pgfId-998088]##A JAX-RPC service endpoint can be realized (or
implemented) using the J2EE component model. This example uses a
stateless session bean for realizing the stock quote service.

[#50634753_pgfId-998523]##The following diagram shows the use case
hierarchy view of the JAX-RPC stock quote service. Later chapters of
this document specify in detail how these use cases are realized by a
JAX-RPC runtime system implementation.

image:jaxrpc-7.gif[image]

===== [#50634753_pgfId-998121]##Service Deployment

[#50634753_pgfId-998296]##Once a JAX-RPC service endpoint has been
defined and implemented, the JAX-RPC deployer deploys the service on a
server-side container based JAX-RPC runtime system. The deployment step
depends on the type of component that has been used to realize a JAX-RPC
service endpoint.

[#50634753_pgfId-998361]##The example stock quote service endpoint is
realized as a stateless session bean and is deployed on an EJB
container. The deployment step includes the generation of container
specific artifacts (skeleton or tie class) based on the service endpoint
interface. A container provided deployment tool provides support for the
deployment of JAX-RPC service endpoints.

[#50634753_pgfId-1029749]##During the deployment of a JAX-RPC service
endpoint, the deployment tool configures one or more protocol bindings
for this service endpoint. A binding ties an abstract service endpoint
definition to a specific protocol and transport. An example of a binding
is SOAP 1.1 protocol binding over HTTP.

[#50634753_pgfId-1058571]##Next, the deployment tool creates one or more
service endpoints for this JAX-RPC service. Each service endpoint is
bound to a specific protocol and transport, and has an assigned endpoint
address based on this protocol binding.

===== [#50634753_pgfId-998201]##[#50634753_59165]##Service Description

[#50634753_pgfId-1015970]##The deployment tool exports the stock quote
service as a WSDL document. The WSDL description of the stock quote
service enables service clients (on any platform) to access this service
and its endpoints.

[#50634753_pgfId-1029756]##A Java-to-WSDL mapping tool (typically part
of a container provided deployment tool) maps the example
_StockQuoteProvider_ service endpoint interface to the following service
description in a WSDL document:

===== [#50634753_pgfId-998596]##Service Use

[#50634753_pgfId-998597]##A service client uses a JAX-RPC service by
invoking remote methods on a service endpoint. Note that a JAX-RPC
service client can call a service endpoint that has been defined and
deployed on a non-Java platform. The converse is also true.

[#50634753_pgfId-998665]##The following diagram shows how a service
client uses stub based model to invoke remote methods on a service
endpoint.

[#50634753_pgfId-998868]##A service client uses the WSDL document (that
describes the stock quote service) to import the stock quote service.

[#50634753_pgfId-1043481]##A WSDL-to-Java mapping tool generates client
side artifacts (includes stub class, service endpoint interface and
additional classes) for the stock quote service and its ports. Note that
a service client may use dynamic invocation interface (DII) or a dynamic
proxy mechanism instead of a generated stub class to invoke a remote
method on a service endpoint.

[#50634753_pgfId-998869]##The JAX-RPC service client programming model

JAX-RPC Mechanisms

[#50634753_pgfId-1016100]##This section describes a brief overview of
the JAX-RPC runtime mechanisms. Note that this description is
illustrative. This example assumes SOAP 1.1 protocol with HTTP as the
transport.

===== [#50634753_pgfId-999997]##Service Client

[#50634753_pgfId-999998]##The following use case hierarchy diagram shows
how a client-side JAX-RPC runtime system process a remote method
invocation on a target service endpoint:

image:jaxrpc-10.gif[image]

[#50634753_pgfId-1016034]##The processing of a remote method call
includes the following steps:

[#50634753_pgfId-1000029]##Mapping of a remote method call to the SOAP
message representation: This includes mapping of the parameters, return
value and exceptions (for the remote method call) to the corresponding
SOAP message; serialization and deserialization based on the mapping
between Java types and XML data types.

[#50634753_pgfId-1000030]##Processing of the SOAP message: This includes
processing of the SOAP message based on the mapping of this remote
method call to the SOAP representation. Encoding style defines how
parameters, return value and types in an remote method call are
represented in the SOAP message.

[#50634753_pgfId-1000031]##Processing of the HTTP request. This includes
transmission of the SOAP request message as part of an HTTP request. A
SOAP response message is transmitted as an HTTP response.

===== [#50634753_pgfId-1078945]##Server Side

[#50634753_pgfId-1000033]##The diagram shows how server-side JAX-RPC
runtime system processes a remote method invocation. Processing of
remote method call on the server side includes the following steps:

[#50634753_pgfId-1000069]##Processing of the HTTP request: Server-side
JAX-RPC runtime system receives and processes the HTTP request.

[#50634753_pgfId-1000099]##Processing of the SOAP message: JAX-RPC
runtime system extracts the SOAP message from the received HTTP request
and processes the SOAP message to get access to the SOAP envelope,
header, body and any attachments. The processing of the SOAP message
uses an XML processing mechanism; examples are streaming parser and SAX
based parser.

[#50634753_pgfId-1000140]##Mapping of the SOAP message to a remote
method call: JAX-RPC runtime system maps the received SOAP message to a
method invocation on the target service endpoint. SOAP body elements
carry parameters and return value for this remote call. SOAP header
carries any context information that is not part of a remote method
signature, but is associated with the remote method call.

[#50634753_pgfId-1000071]##Dispatch to the target JAX-RPC service
endpoint: JAX-RPC runtime system invokes method on the target service
endpoint based on the mapping of the received remote method invocation.
Return value, out parameters and exceptions are carried in the SOAP body
and fault elements respectively and are processed as part of the HTTP
response.

Requirements

image:jaxrpc-4.gif[image]

[#50634753_pgfId-1000077]##This chapter specifies the proposed scope and
requirements for the 1.1 version of JAX-RPC specification. These
requirements are addressed in detail in the later chapters.

==== [#50634753_pgfId-1067281]##

image:jaxrpc-5.gif[image]

[#50634753_85601]##Protocol Bindings

[#50634753_pgfId-1088327]##A goal of the JAX-RPC specification is to
enable support for multiple protocol bindings that are based on the XML
Information Set (Infoset) link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_68504[See XML
Information Set: http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xml-infoset-20011024/].
For example, SOAP 1.2 messages are specified as XML Infosets. JAX-RPC
allows support for binary protocol bindings that are based on the XML
infoset but do not carry XML 1.0 documents. Note that the use of term
“XML based protocol” in this document is consistent with this goal.

[#50634753_pgfId-1087993]##Based on this goal, the JAX-RPC core APIs
(defined in the _javax.xml.rpc_ package) are defined to be independent
of any specific protocol bindings. For the SOAP protocol binding,
JAX-RPC specifies APIs in the _javax.xml.rpc.soap_ package.

[#50634753_pgfId-1087968]##A JAX-RPC runtime system implementation is
required to support the SOAP 1.1 with attachments protocol. Refer to the
link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_24046[See Interoperability] for the
interoperability requirements related to the protocol bindings for the
JAX-RPC runtime system implementations. SOAP message with attachments
link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_28069[See W3 Note: SOAP Messages with
Attachments: http://www.w3.org/TR/SOAP-attachments] defines binding for
a SOAP 1.1 message to be carried within a MIME _multipart/related_
message.

[#50634753_pgfId-1088033]##Note that the required support of SOAP 1.1
with attachments protocol must not preclude or limit use of other
protocol bindings and transport in a JAX-RPC runtime system
implementation.

[#50634753_pgfId-1087982]##

image:jaxrpc-12.gif[image]

The JAX-RPC specification would consider support for the SOAP 1.2
protocol when the SOAP 1.2 W3C specification
link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_65269[See W3C: SOAP 1.2:
http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/CR-soap12-part1-20021219/ and
http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/CR-soap12-part2-20021219/] reaches the final
recommendation stage. This would be addressed in the future versions of
the JAX-RPC specification.

Transport

[#50634753_pgfId-999027]##A JAX-RPC runtime system implementation is
required to support HTTP 1.1 as the transport for SOAP messages. HTTP
binding for the SOAP messages is based on the SOAP 1.1 specification
link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_71367[See J2EE Specifications:
http://java.sun.com/j2ee/].

[#50634753_pgfId-999042]##Note that the required support of HTTP 1.1
must not mean that the HTTP transport is the only transport that can be
supported by a JAX-RPC runtime system implementation. JAX-RPC core APIs
are designed to be transport-neutral. This enables JAX-RPC APIs to be
usable with any transport that supports ability to deliver SOAP messages
and has a defined protocol binding for the SOAP 1.1 protocol.

[#50634753_pgfId-1001186]##JAX-RPC specification does not preclude the
use of SOAP binding with a transport that supports security mechanisms.
However, the specification of SOAP bindings to transports that support
security is outside the scope of the JAX-RPC specification.

[#50634753_pgfId-1028326]##A JAX-RPC runtime system implementation is
not required to support HTTP/S as the underlying secure transport. Refer
to the link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_28459[See Interoperability] for the
interoperability requirements.

XML Encoding for SOAP Messages

[#50634753_pgfId-1058425]##The JAX-RPC specification requires support
for both encoded and literal representations of a SOAP message
representing an RPC call or response.

section 5 encoding) link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_71367[See J2EE
Specifications: http://java.sun.com/j2ee/] defines rules for the
encoding of XML data types. This encoding can be used in conjunction
with the mapping of SOAP based RPC calls and responses. The supported
data types in the SOAP 1.1 encoding include the following:

[#50634753_pgfId-1091247]##Built-in datatypes specified in the XML
Schema Part 2: Datatypes specification
link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_26228[See W3C Recommendation “XML Schema Part

2: Datatypes specification

[#50634753_pgfId-1091249]##Compound types that include Struct and Array

[#50634753_pgfId-1058471]##Serialization and deserialization support for
compound types that are neither Struct nor an Array

[#50634753_pgfId-1058456]##The use of SOAP 1.1 encoding must not
preclude use of any other encoding in a JAX-RPC runtime system
implementation. However, the use of a specialized encoding constrains
the interoperability of a JAX-RPC runtime system implementation. Refer

JAX-RPC Runtime System

[#50634753_pgfId-1058495]##The JAX-RPC runtime system forms the core of
a JAX-RPC implementation. JAX-RPC runtime system is a library (part of
both service client and server side environments) that provides a set of
services required for the JAX-RPC runtime mechanisms.

[#50634753_pgfId-1058482]##The JAX-RPC specification identifies the

JAX-RPC runtime system:

[#50634753_pgfId-1058483]##J2SE based JAX-RPC runtime system

[#50634753_pgfId-1058484]##Servlet container based JAX-RPC runtime

[#50634753_93831]##Application level Modes of Interaction

[#50634753_pgfId-1000682]##The JAX-RPC specification supports the
following modes of interaction between a client and service endpoint.
Note that these interaction modes are visible as part of the JAX-RPC
programming model and are termed application level interaction modes.

[#50634753_pgfId-1016664]##The JAX-RPC specification does not address
how a JAX-RPC runtime system implementation provides support for these
application level interaction modes. A JAX-RPC runtime system may use
more primitive implementation specific interaction modes to implement
support for these application level interaction modes.

[#50634753_pgfId-1016689]##The JAX-RPC specification requires that any
implementation specific mechanisms or implementation level interaction
modes must not be exposed to the JAX-RPC programming model.

[#50634753_pgfId-1016801]##The JAX-RPC specification does not define any
qualities of service QoS (examples: guarantees of message delivery,
reliable messaging, use of intermediaries) related to the application
level interaction modes. A JAX-RPC runtime system may support such QoS
mechanisms. Note that the JAX-RPC specification does not preclude such
implementation-specific QoS support.

[#50634753_pgfId-1011696]##A service client invokes a remote method on a
target service endpoint and receives a return value or an exception. The
client invocation thread blocks while the remote method invocation is
processed by the service endpoint. Eventually, the service client gets a
return (this may be _void_ type) or an exception from the invoked remote
method.

[#50634753_pgfId-1011720]##The JAX-RPC specification does not define how
a JAX-RPC runtime system implements support for the synchronous
request-response mode in terms of the underlying protocol and transport.
Refer to the SOAP 1.2 specification Part 2

transport message exchange patterns and default HTTP binding.

[#50634753_pgfId-1016712]##The JAX-RPC APIs and service client
programming model support synchronous request-response mode through both
the stub (or dynamic proxy) based model and DII _Call_ interface.

======= [#50634753_pgfId-1000684]##One-way RPC Mode

image:jaxrpc-14.gif[image]

[#50634753_pgfId-1016744]##A service client invokes a remote method on a
service endpoint in the one-way mode. The client invocation thread does
not block and continues execution without waiting for this remote method
invocation to be processed by the service endpoint. The service client
does not get any return value, _out_ parameters or any remote exception
for this method invocation. Note that a JAX-RPC client runtime system
may throw an exception during the processing of an one-way RPC call.

[#50634753_pgfId-1102372]##The non-blocking behavior, message delivery
and processing of the one-way RPC mode depends on the underlying
protocol and transport. The JAX-RPC specification does not specify how a
JAX-RPC runtime system implements one-way RPC mode in terms of the
underlying protocol and transport. For example, HTTP is a
request-response protocol. In the one-way RPC mode, the client may
handle the HTTP response with either success or error code (but with no
entity-body content) as part of the invocation of a one-way RPC. In
another case, a JAX-RPC client runtime system may achieve non-blocking
behavior for one-way RPC by pipelining multiple HTTP requests without
waiting for responses. A J2SE based JAX-RPC client runtime system
(targeted for a less restrictive non-managed environment) may choose to
create thread for a one-way RPC dispatch.

[#50634753_pgfId-1102413]##Note that a client should not rely on any
specific guarantees of message delivery and processing semantics or
quality of services (QoS) in the one-way RPC mode.

[#50634753_pgfId-1028496]##The JAX-RPC specification supports the
one-way interaction mode through the DII _Call_ interface. Refer to the
link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_87541[See DII Call Interface] for more details.

[#50634753_pgfId-1058891]##The JAX-RPC specification does not specify
any standard APIs for the design of asynchronous stubs. This feature
will be addressed in the future version of the JAX-RPC specification.
This will lead to the support for both one-way and non-blocking RPC
interaction modes.

======= [#50634753_pgfId-1012011]##Non-blocking RPC Invocation

[#50634753_pgfId-1012079]##A service client invokes a remote method on a
service endpoint and continues processing in the same thread without
waiting for the return of the remote method invocation. Later, the
service client processes the remote method return by performing blocking
receive or by polling for the return value. In this case, a service
client is responsible for performing the correlation between the remote
method call and subsequent response.

[#50634753_pgfId-1028518]##A JAX-RPC runtime system is not required to
support the non-blocking RPC interaction mode. This interaction mode
will be addressed in the future versions of the JAX-RPC specification.

Relationship to JAXM and SAAJ

[#50634753_pgfId-1106400]##The JAXM (Java API for XML messaging)
specification specifies the standard Java APIs to support asynchronous
document based messaging based on the SOAP protocol. The JAXM API has
two packages:

[#50634753_pgfId-1106401]##The _javax.xml.soap package_ specifies API to
represent a SOAP message with attachments. This API enables developers
to access, create and manipulate a SOAP message. JAXM allows profiles
(example: ebXML TRP) to be defined over this base SOAP package. These
layered profiles define additional mechanisms, abstractions and
conventions on top of the base SOAP abstraction.

[#50634753_pgfId-1106402]##The _javax.xml.messaging_ package specifies
API for developing clients and message-driven bean based endpoints to
support document based asynchronous messaging.

[#50634753_pgfId-1106471]##Note that the maintenance release of JAXM 1.1
has created a new specification document named "SOAP with Attachments
API for Java (’SAAJ’)" link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_22105[See JAXM
specification: http://java.sun.com/xml/jaxm/] for the _javax.xml.soap_
package. The maintenance release also makes the _javax.xml.soap_ package
independent of the _javax.xml.messaging_ package.

[#50634753_pgfId-1110959]##JAX-RPC 1.1 implementations are required to
support the SAAJ 1.2 APIs.

[#50634753_pgfId-1016899]##In relation to the JAX-RPC specification, the
JAXM specification does not define any mapping between WSDL and Java. It
also does not define any standard type mapping between the XML data
types and Java types.Both JAXM and JAX-RPC use SOAP 1.1 with attachments
as the underlying protocol. Refer link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_85601[See
Protocol Bindings] for the JAX-RPC requirement related to the protocol
bindings.

[#50634753_pgfId-1106475]##The JAX-RPC specification specifies APIs for
the development of SOAP message handlers for SOAP message processing.
These SOAP message handlers are based on the _javax.xml.soap_ package.

[#50634753_pgfId-1058794]##The JAX-RPC specification also defines SOAP
protocol binding specific APIs in the _javax.xml.rpc.soap_ package. This
package uses the Java APIs defined in the _javax.xml.soap_ package.
JAX-RPC also uses the _javax.xml.soap_ APIs to represent mapping of
literal fragments carried in a SOAP message.

[#50634753_83956]##Service Context

[#50634753_pgfId-1028616]##A remote method call or response may carry
context information (termed as service context). Examples are service
contexts for transaction management (example: unique transaction
identifier), security (example: digital signature) or session
management.

[#50634753_pgfId-1043948]##The JAX-RPC specification specifies a
non-normative programming model for the processing of service context.
Refer to the link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_66333[See Service Context] for
more details. Note that the JAX-RPC specification does not (nor intends
to, in future) specify the semantic content of the service contexts.

[#50634753_pgfId-1042956]##If SOAP is the underlying protocol, service
context information is carried in the SOAP header of a SOAP message.
Note that neither SOAP 1.1 nor SOAP 1.2 specification defines any
standard SOAP header representation for the transaction or security
related context.

[#50634753_pgfId-1010925]##An explicit goal of the JAX-RPC specification
is not to define any SOAP header representation for transaction,
security or session related information. A goal of JAX-RPC specification
is to leverage work done in other standardization groups for this
aspect. An important point to note is that any JAX-RPC specific
definition of SOAP headers or session related information is against the
design goal of achieving SOAP based interoperability with heterogeneous
environments.

SOAP Messages with Attachments

[#50634753_pgfId-1067305]##The SOAP 1.1 message with attachments defines
a binding for a SOAP message to be carried within a MIME
_multipart/related_ message. A SOAP message can be transmitted together
with attached data in a MIME encoded representation.

[#50634753_pgfId-1067306]##The JAX-RPC specification provides support
for SOAP message with attachments as the underlying protocol.

[#50634753_pgfId-1067307]##A remote method call may include MIME encoded
content as a parameter or a return value. A typical use case is passing
or return of an XML document or binary image (in JPEG or GIF format) in
a remote method call.

[#50634753_58984]##SOAP Message Handler

[#50634753_pgfId-1091364]##The JAX-RPC specification specifies the
requirements and APIs for the SOAP message handler. A SOAP message
handler gets access to the SOAP message that represents either an RPC
request or response. A typical use of a SOAP message handler is to
process the SOAP header blocks as part of the processing of an RPC
request or response.

[#50634753_pgfId-1091367]##Note that other types of handlers (for
example; stream based handlers, post-binding typed handlers) may also be
developed for an implementation of a JAX-RPC runtime system. However,
JAX-RPC specification specifies APIs for only the SOAP message handlers.
Future versions of the JAX-RPC specification would add support for other
types of handlers.

Literal Mode

[#50634753_pgfId-1028637]##When the SOAP binding is used, an RPC call
with its parameters and return value is assembled inside the body
element of a SOAP message. A message part may be either encoded using
some encoding rules or may represent a concrete schema definition; the
latter is termed literal representation.

[#50634753_pgfId-1028638]##The JAX-RPC specification requires support
for the literal representation of an RPC request or response in the SOAP
body. Refer to the link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_43535[See Literal

[#50634753_67228]##Application Portability

[#50634753_pgfId-1067322]##The JAX-RPC specification requires that
service client and service endpoint code be portable across multiple
JAX-RPC runtime system implementations.

[#50634753_pgfId-1067327]##In the 1.1 version, portable JAX-RPC service
client or service endpoint code should not depend on any pluggable
vendor-specific serializers and deserializers.

[#50634753_pgfId-1091503]##To achieve portability, the JAX-RPC
specification does not require portable stubs and skeletons. The
stub/skeleton classes and other generated artifacts are generated by a
deployment tool (provided with a J2EE container or a JAX-RPC runtime
system) during the deployment of a JAX-RPC service endpoint or a service
client. In the 1.1 version, these generated artifacts are specific to a
JAX-RPC implementation.

[#50634753_pgfId-1067404]##The identifier and Java type of a property in

given in link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_43750[See Simple Types Derived By
Restriction].

[#50634753_pgfId-1111104]##The mapped Java class declares a _getValue_
method, two static data members per label, an integer conversion method
and a constructor as follows:

[#50634753_pgfId-1094088]##All _<label> and _<label>_ used in the mapped
Java class (for XML enumeration) are required to be valid Java
identifiers. According to the Java language specification, a Java
identifier cannot have the same spelling as a Java keyword, _Boolean_
literal or _null_ literal.

[#50634753_pgfId-1094112]##If one or more enumerated values in an XML
enumeration cannot map to valid Java identifiers (examples are “3.14”,
“int”), the mapped Java class is required to use Java identifiers
_value<1..N>_ and _ _value<1..N>_ for _<label>_ and __<label>_ (as in
the above mapping code snippet) respectively. The numeric suffix starts
from 1 and increments by 1 per value in the XML enumeration. Examples
are __value1_ , _value1_ , _value2_ and __value2_ .

===== [#50634753_pgfId-1109661]##[#50634753_43750]##Simple Types Derived By Restriction

[#50634753_pgfId-1109660]##The XML Schema specification allows the
definition of new simple types obtained by restricting an existing
simple type. Restrictions on the set of allowed values are specified
using one or more of 12 predefined facets.

[#50634753_pgfId-1109703]##A simple type derived by restriction from
another simple type, referred to as its base type, is mapped to the same
Java type that its base type is mapped to. If its base type does not
have a standard JAX-RPC mapping (i.e. is unsupported), then the derived
type itself is unsupported.

[#50634753_pgfId-1109705]##Several built-in types defined in the XML
Schema specification are derived by restriction from other types for
which JAX-RPC provides a standard mapping. Such types must in
consequence be mapped according to the rules in the preceding
paragraphs.

======= [#50634753_pgfId-1109717]##Example

[#50634753_pgfId-1109710]##The built-in _xsd:normalizedString_ type is
derived by restriction from _xsd:string_ , hence it must be mapped to
_java.lang.String_ .

======= [#50634753_pgfId-1109712]##Example

[#50634753_pgfId-1109713]##The following schema fragment defines a new
simple type by restriction of the _xsd:int_ type. Consequently, it must
be mapped to the Java _int_ type.

===== [#50634753_pgfId-1109662]##[#50634753_26103]##Simple Types Derived Using xsd:list

[#50634753_pgfId-1109663]##In XML Schema, simple type definitions can
specify xsd:list as their derivation mechanism. In this case, they also
specify an _item type_ which must itself be a simple type.

[#50634753_pgfId-1109757]##Simple types defined using _xsd:list_ and
whose item type has a standard JAX-RPC mapping are mapped to
arrays.These types include all built-in XML Schema types defined in the
same way, such as _xsd:NMTOKENS_ . The component type of the resulting
array is mapped from the item type of the simpel type.

WSDL to Java Mapping[#50634753_51248]##

[#50634753_pgfId-1109654]##This section specifies the mapping of a
service described in a WSDL document to the corresponding Java
representation.

===== [#50634753_pgfId-1020447]##WSDL [#50634753_33943]##Document

[#50634753_pgfId-1070940]##A WSDL document is mapped to a Java package.
The fully qualified name of the mapped Java package is specific to an
application and is specified during the WSDL to Java mapping. A WSDL to
Java mapping tool is required to support the configuration of the
application specific package name during the mapping.

[#50634753_pgfId-1070950]##Note that the JAX-RPC specification does not
specify the standard mapping of a namespace definition (in a WSDL
document) to the corresponding Java package name. However, the JAX-RPC
requires that a namespace definition in a WSDL document must be mapped
to a unique Java package name. The name of the mapped Java package must
follow the package naming conventions defined in the Java Language
Specification link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_94614[See Java Language
Specification: http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/].

[#50634753_pgfId-1044180]##The WSDL 1.1 specification allows references
to the various WSDL definitions (examples: _portType_ , _message_ ).
Such _QName_ based references in WSDL are mapped based on the Java
package and name scoping conventions.

===== [#50634753_pgfId-1005292]##Extensibility Elements

[#50634753_pgfId-1018228]##The WSDL 1.1 specification allows definition
of extensibility elements (that may be specific to a binding or
technology) under various element definitions.

[#50634753_pgfId-1018231]##The JAX-RPC specification specifies mapping
of the extensibility elements for SOAP and MIME bindings. Refer to the
link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_75805[See SOAP Binding] and
link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_29571[See WSDL Requirements]. However, the
JAX-RPC specification does not address mapping of any vendor specific
extensibility elements. A JAX-RPC implementation may support mapping of
WSDL extensibility elements at the cost of interoperability and
application portability.

===== [#50634753_pgfId-1018224]##WSDL [#50634753_43187]##Port Type

[#50634753_pgfId-1018295]##A WSDL port type is a named set of abstract
operations and messages involved.

[#50634753_pgfId-1003724]##A WSDL port type is mapped to a Java
interface (termed a Service Endpoint Interface) that extends the
_java.rmi.Remote_ interface. The mapping of a _wsdl:portType_ to a
service endpoint interface may use the _wsdl:binding_ element. Refer to
the link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_63057[See SOAP Binding in WSDL] for details
on the use of the _soap:binding_ definition in the mapping of a WSDL
port type.

[#50634753_pgfId-1107611]##The _name_ of the Service endpoint interface
is mapped from the _name_ attribute of the _wsdl:portType_ element. Note
that a port type name attribute defines a unique name among all the port
types defined in an enclosing WSDL document. Refer to the
link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_96144[See XML Names] for the mapping of the XML
names to Java identifiers.

[#50634753_pgfId-1107604]##The mapped Java service endpoint interface
contains methods mapped from the _wsdl:operation_ elements defined in
the _wsdl:portType_ . Refer to the link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_88615[See
WSDL Operation] for the standard mapping of a _wsdl:operation_
definition.

[#50634753_pgfId-1003867]##Since WSDL does not support inheritance of
the port types, the standard Java mapping of the WSDL port type does not
define support for the inheritance of the mapped Java interfaces.

[#50634753_pgfId-1028795]##Each method of the mapped Java interface is
required to declare _java.rmi._ _RemoteException_ in its throws clause.
A _RemoteException_ is the common superclass for exceptions related to a
remote method invocation. Examples are: _java.rmi.MarshalException_ ,
_java.rmi.ConnectException_ . Refer to the J2SE
link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_70636[See J2SE: http://java.sun.com/j2se/]
documentation for more details on the _RemoteException_ .

[#50634753_pgfId-1028807]##A method may also throw service specific
exceptions based on the mapping of a WSDL faults. Refer to the
link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_91875[See WSDL Fault] for more details.

======= [#50634753_pgfId-1003766]##Example

[#50634753_pgfId-1003789]##The following is an example of a port type
definition in a WSDL document:

[#50634753_pgfId-1003790]## _<!-- WSDL Extract -->_

[#50634753_pgfId-1018261]## _<message name=”getLastTradePrice”>_

[#50634753_pgfId-1003798]##The above WSDL port type definition maps to
the following Java service endpoint interface:

[#50634753_pgfId-1003833]## throws java.rmi.RemoteException;

[#50634753_pgfId-1003829]##}

===== [#50634753_pgfId-1004193]##WSDL [#50634753_88615]##Operation

[#50634753_pgfId-1073659]##A _wsdl:operation_ defined in a
_wsdl:portType_ maps to a Java method on the mapped Java service
endpoint interface. The mapping of a _wsdl:operation_ to a Java method
may include the use of the _wsdl:binding_ element. Refer to the
link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_63057[See SOAP Binding in WSDL] for the use of
the _soap:binding_ element in the mapping of a WSDL operation.

[#50634753_pgfId-1073660]##A _wsdl:operation_ is named by the _name_
attribute. The operation _name_ maps to the name of the corresponding
method on the mapped Java service endpoint interface. Refer to the
link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_96144[See XML Names] for the mapping of XML
names to Java identifiers.

[#50634753_pgfId-1005407]##Note that the WSDL 1.1 specification does not
require that operation names be unique. To support overloading of
operations, the _wsdl:binding_ element identifies correct operation by
providing the _name_ attributes of the corresponding _wsdl:input_ and
_wsdl:output_ elements. Refer to the WSDL 1.1 for complete details.

[#50634753_pgfId-1097521]##In the WSDL to Java mapping, overloaded
operations are mapped to overloaded Java methods provided the
overloading does not cause any conflicts in the mapped Java interface
declaration and follows the Java Language specification
link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_94614[See Java Language Specification:
http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/].

[#50634753_pgfId-1018313]##The JAX-RPC specification supports the
mapping of operations with _request_ - _response_ and _one-way_
transmission primitives. The standard Java mapping of operations defined
with other transmission primitives ( _notification_ , _solicit-response_
) is considered out of scope in the JAX-RPC specification.

[#50634753_pgfId-1005412]##The message parts in the _wsdl:input_ and
_wsdl:output_ elements defined in an abstract WSDL operation are mapped
to parameters on the corresponding Java method signature. The name of
the Java method parameter is mapped from the _name_ attribute of the
corresponding message _part_ . The optional _wsdl:fault_ element maps to
an exception. Refer to the link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_91875[See WSDL
Fault] for more details on the Java mapping of WSDL faults.

======= [#50634753_pgfId-1005404]##Parameter Passing Modes

[#50634753_pgfId-1018360]##The JAX-RPC specification does not support a
pass by reference mode for a remote service. JAX-RPC does not support
passing of a _java.rmi.Remote_ instance in a remote method invocation.

======= [#50634753_pgfId-1044250]##WSDL parameterOrder

[#50634753_pgfId-1091607]##According to the WSDL 1.1 specification, a
request-response operation may specify a list of parameters using the
_parameterOrder_ attribute. The value of the _parameterOrder_ attribute
follows these rules:

[#50634753_pgfId-1091608]##The _parameterOrder_ attribute reflects the
order of the parameters in the RPC signature

[#50634753_pgfId-1091609]##The return value part is not present in the
_parameterOrder_ list

[#50634753_pgfId-1091610]##If a part name appears in both the input and
output message with the same type, it is an _inout_ parameter

[#50634753_pgfId-1091611]##If a part name appears in only the
_wsdl:input_ message, it is an _in_ parameter

[#50634753_pgfId-1091612]##If a part name appears in only the
_wsdl:output_ message, it is an _out_ parameter

[#50634753_pgfId-1094335]##The order of parameters in an RPC signature
follows these rules:

[#50634753_pgfId-1094336]##Part names are either listed in the
_parameterOrder_ attribute or are unlisted. If there is no
_parameterOrder_ attribute, then all part names are considered unlisted.

[#50634753_pgfId-1094383]##If the _parameterOrder_ attribute is
specified, then all part names from the input message must be listed.
The part names from the output message may or may not be listed.

[#50634753_pgfId-1094394]##Listed part names appear first in the method
signature in the order that they are listed in the _parameterOrder_
attribute.

[#50634753_pgfId-1094401]##Unlisted part names appear following the
listed part names in the order in which these parts appear in the
message: first, the input message’s part names; next, the output
message’s part names. If an unlisted part is a component of an _inout_
parameter, then it appears in the order in which its corresponding part
appears in the input message (the order of output message parts is
ignored for _inout_ parameters).

[#50634753_pgfId-1094351]##If there is a single unlisted output part
that is not a component of an inout parameter, then it is the return
type. Otherwise, the return type is _void_ .

[#50634753_pgfId-1094283]##The JAX-RPC specification specifies the
following rules for the _in_ , _out_ and _inout_ parameter passing modes
and return value:

[#50634753_pgfId-1091614]##An _in_ parameter is passed as copy. The
value of the _in_ parameter is copied before a remote method invocation.

[#50634753_pgfId-1091618]##The return value is created as a copy and
returned to the caller from a remote method invocation. The caller
becomes the owner of the returned object after completion of the remote
method invocation.

[#50634753_pgfId-1091619]##The _out_ and _inout_ parameters are passed
by copy. Parameter passing mode for _out_ and _inout_ parameters uses
_Holder_ classes. Refer to the link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_94013[See Holder
Classes]. A service client provides an instance of a _Holder_ class that
is passed by value for either _out_ or _inout_ parameter. The contents
of the _Holder_ class are modified in the remote method invocation and
the service client uses the changed contents after the method invocation

[#50634753_pgfId-1018541]##The JAX-RPC specification requires use of the
_Holder_ classes as part of the standard Java mapping of a WSDL
operation. The use of _Holder_ classes enables the mapping to preserve
the intended _wsdl:operation_ signature and parameter passing semantics.

[#50634753_pgfId-1018542]##The JAX-RPC specification includes _Holder_
classes for the Java mapping of the simple XML data types (including
_xsd:base64Binary_ , _xsd.hexBinary_ , _soapenc:base64_ ) in the j
_avax.xml.rpc.holders_ package. Refer to the
link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_93728[See Simple Types] for the Java mapping of
the simple XML data types.

[#50634753_pgfId-1097068]##The _Holder_ classes for the Java primitive
types are defined in the _javax.xml. rpc.holders_ package. The name of
the _Holder_ class is the name of the Java primitive type appended with
the suffix _Holder_ . The initial letter of the Java type name is
capitalized. An example is _javax.xml.rpc.holders.FloatHolder_ for the
Java primitive type _float_ .

[#50634753_pgfId-1097057]##The name of the _Holder_ class for a Java
wrapper class (that wraps a primitive Java type) is derived by appending
the suffix _WrapperHolder_ to the name of the wrapper class. These
holders for the Java wrapper classes are also packaged in the
_javax.xml.rpc. holders_ package. An example is the
_javax.xml.rpc.holders.FloatWrapperHolder_ class for the wrapper class
_java.lang.Float_ .

[#50634753_pgfId-1044371]##A WSDL to Java mapping tool generates
_Holder_ classes for XML data types other than the simple XML data
types. Examples are _Holder_ classes generated for the complex XML types
and extended simple XML data types based on the XML schema
specification.

[#50634753_pgfId-1003940]##For the complex XML data types, the name of
the _Holder_ class is constructed by appending _Holder_ to the name of
the corresponding Java class. These generated _Holder_ classes are
packaged as part of the generated sub package named _holders_ in the
WSDL to Java mapping. Refer to the section
link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_33943[See WSDL Document] for the mapping of the
Java package. An example is _com.example.holders.BookHolder_ .

[#50634753_pgfId-1097092]##The name of the _Holder_ class in the Java
mapping of an XML array is the name of the complex type (first letter
capitalized) appended with the _Holder_ suffix. Refer to the example
later in this section.

[#50634753_pgfId-1003941]##Each _Holder_ class provides the following
methods and fields:

[#50634753_pgfId-1003950]##A public field named _value_ . The type of
_value_ is the mapped Java type

{empty}[#50634753_pgfId-1003942]##A default constructor that initializes
the _value_ field to a default value. The default values for the Java
types are as specified in the Java Language Specification
link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_94614[See Java Language Specification:
http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/]

[#50634753_pgfId-1003944]##A constructor that sets the _value_ field to
the passed parameter

[#50634753_pgfId-1028936]##A standard or generated holder class is
required to implement the marker _javax.xml.rpc.holders.Holder_
interface. The following code snippet shows the _Holder_ interface:

[#50634753_pgfId-1105500]##package _javax.xml.rpc.holders_ ;

[#50634753_pgfId-1105503]##public interface Holder \{

[#50634753_pgfId-1105501]##}

[#50634753_pgfId-1097979]##A JAX-RPC implementation is required to
support serialization and deserialization of the value contained in a
_Holder_ class. This requirement holds for all types of _Holder_ classes
irrespective of whether a _Holder_ class is generated or is part of the
standard _javax.xml.rpc.holders_ package.

[#50634753_pgfId-1105525]##The following are the standard _Holder_
classes specified in the _javax.xml.rpc.holders_ package:

[#50634753_pgfId-1028209]##The _wsdl:fault_ element (an optional element
in a _wsdl:operation_ ) specifies the abstract message format for any
error messages that may be output as a result of a remote operation.
According to the WSDL specification, a fault message must have a single
part.

[#50634753_pgfId-1100880]##A _wsdl:fault_ is mapped to either a
_java.rmi.RemoteException_ (or its subclass), service specific Java
exception (described later in this section) or a _javax.xml.rpc_ .
_soap.SOAPFaultException_ . Refer to the
link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_50628[See SOAP Fault] for more details on the
Java mapping of a WSDL fault based on the SOAP binding.

======= [#50634753_pgfId-1104367]##Service Specific Exception

[#50634753_pgfId-1104368]##A service specific Java exception (mapped
from a _wsdl:fault_ and the corresponding _wsdl:message_ ) extends the
class _java.lang.Exception_ directly or indirectly.

[#50634753_pgfId-1105363]##The single message part in the _wsdl:message_
(referenced from the _wsdl:fault_ element) may be either a type or an
element. If the former, it can be either a _xsd:complexType_ or a simple
XML type.

[#50634753_pgfId-1108179]##Each element inside the _xsd:complexType_ is
mapped to a getter method and a parameter in the constructor of the Java
exception. Mapping of these elements follows the standard XML to Java
type mapping. The name of the Java exception class is mapped from the
_name_ attribute of the _xsd:complexType_ for the single message part.
This naming scheme enables the WSDL to Java mapping to map an
_xsd:complexType_ derivation hierarchy to the corresponding Java
exception class hierarchy. The following section illustrates an example.
Refer to the link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_96144[See XML Names] for the
mapping of XML names to Java identifiers.

[#50634753_pgfId-1105439]##If the single message part in the
_wsdl:message_ (referenced from the _wsdl:fault_ element) has a simple
XML type or array, then this element is mapped to a getter method and a
parameter in the constructor of the Java exception. In this case, the
_name_ of the Java exception class is mapped from the _name_ attribute
of the _wsdl:message_ element.

[#50634753_pgfId-1110103]##If the single message part in the
_wsdl:message_ refers to an element, then the type of that element is
used to derive the corresponding Java exception class using the rules in
the preceding paragraph.

[#50634753_pgfId-1110111]##The mapped service specific Java exception is
declared as a checked exception in the corresponding Java method mapping
for the _wsdl:operation_ element. This is in addition to the required
_java.rmi.RemoteException_ .

[#50634753_pgfId-1104375]##The following shows an example of the mapping

[#50634753_pgfId-1104388]##The following is the Java service endpoint
interface derived from the above WSDL port type definition. Note that

interface. This implementation class is required to support the creation
of both dynamic proxies and _Call_ objects.

[#50634753_pgfId-1073752]##The JAX-RPC specification does not specify
the design of a service implementation class. The base _Service_
interface is implemented in a vendor specific manner. For example, a
_Service_ implementation class may be created with a reference to an
in-memory representation of the WSDL service description.

[#50634753_pgfId-1073744]##The method _getPort_ ( _QName_ , Class)
returns a dynamic proxy or instance of a generated stub class for the
specified service endpoint. A JAX-RPC service client uses the returned
dynamic proxy or stub instance to invoke operations on the target
service endpoint. The parameter _serviceEndpointInterface_ specifies the
service endpoint interface that must be supported by the created dynamic
proxy or stub instance.

[#50634753_pgfId-1103389]##The method _getPort_ ( _Class_ ) returns
either an instance of a generated stub implementation class or a dynamic
proxy. The parameter _serviceEndpoint_ - Interface specifies the service
endpoint interface that is supported by the returned stub or proxy. In
the implementation of this method, the JAX-RPC runtime system takes the
responsibility of selecting a protocol binding (and a port) and
configuring the stub accordingly. The returned _Stub_ instance should
not be reconfigured by the client.

[#50634753_pgfId-1067562]##This _getPort_ method throws
_ServiceException_ if there is an error in the creation of a dynamic
proxy/stub instance or if there is any missing WSDL related metadata as
required by this method implementation.

[#50634753_pgfId-1103403]##The method _getPorts_ returns a list of
qualified names (as _javax.xml.namespace_ . _QName_ ) of ports grouped
by this service.

[#50634753_pgfId-1067563]##The multiple variants of the method
_createCall_ create instances of the _javax.xml. rpc.Call_ . Refer to
the link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_87541[See DII Call Interface] and Javadocs
for more details on these methods. The _createCall_ method throws
_ServiceException_ if there is any error in the creation of the _Call_
object.

[#50634753_pgfId-1103499]##The _getCalls_ method returns an array of
preconfigured _Call_ objects for invoking operations on the specified
port. There is one _Call_ object per operation that can be invoked on
the specified port. A pre-configured _Call_ object does not need to be
configured using the setter methods on the _Call_ interface. Each
invocation of the _getCalls_ method is required to return a new array of
preconfigured _Call_ objects. This enables _Service_ implementation
class to avoid side effects of any setter methods that are invoked on
the returned _Call_ objects.

[#50634753_pgfId-1106062]##The _getCalls_ method requires the _Service_
implementation class to have access to the WSDL related metadata. This
method throws _ServiceException_ if this _Service_ instance does not
have access to the required WSDL metadata or if an illegal _portName_ is
specified.

information (example: user name, password) as parameters. These
additional getter methods are specific to a JAX-RPC implementation.

[#50634753_pgfId-1075063]##The JAX-RPC specification does not require
support for the passing or return of a remote reference across a remote
method invocation. The reason is that SOAP
link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_65269[See W3C: SOAP 1.2:
http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/CR-soap12-part1-20021219/ and
http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/CR-soap12-part2-20021219/] specifies
object-by-reference as out of scope in both the 1.1 and 1.2 versions.
Any support for remote reference passing in the JAX-RPC would be
non-standard and hence constrain interoperability.

[#50634753_pgfId-1045847]##A service endpoint interface must not include
a remote reference as either a parameter or a return type. A Java array
or JAX-RPC value type must not include a remote reference as a contained
element.

[#50634753_pgfId-1045864]##The following is an example of a

[#50634753_pgfId-1005531]##In the above example, the return type for the

[#50634753_pgfId-1093720]##Note that the SOAP 1.1 specification
indicates that all SOAP encoded elements are _nillable_ . So in the SOAP
encoded case, the Java wrapper class for a Java primitive type is mapped
to the corresponding SOAP encoded type. For example, the
_java.lang.Integer_ maps to _soapenc:int_ if the SOAP encoding is being
used.

[#50634753_pgfId-1095518]##This section specifies requirements for the
JAX-RPC value types.

[#50634753_pgfId-1095519]##A JAX-RPC value type is a Java class whose
value can be moved between a service client and service endpoint. A Java
class must follow these rules to be a JAX-RPC conformant value type:

constructor.

[#50634753_pgfId-1080717]##Java class must not implement (directly or
indirectly) the _java.rmi.Remote_ interface.

[#50634753_pgfId-1080718]##Java class may implement any Java interface
(except the _java.rmi.Remote_ interface) or extend another Java class.

[#50634753_pgfId-1080719]##Java class may contain public, private,

fields.

[#50634753_pgfId-1095537]##Java class for a JAX-RPC value type may be
designed as a JavaBeans class. In this case, the bean properties (as
defined by the JavaBeans introspection) are required to follow the
JavaBeans design pattern of setter and getter methods. The Java type of
a bean property must be a supported JAX-RPC type as specified in the

_xsd:complexType_ with either the _xsd:all_ or the _xsd:sequence_
compositor. Please notice that the XML Schema specification places
several restrictions on the contents of a particle that uses the
_xsd:all_ compositor.

[#50634753_pgfId-1111079]##The standard Java to XML mapping of a JAX-RPC
value type must follow these rules:

[#50634753_pgfId-1080756]##The _name_ attribute of the _xsd:complexType_
is mapped from the name of the Java class for the JAX-RPC value type.

[#50634753_pgfId-1080757]##Each public non-final non-transient field in
the Java class is mapped to an element in the _xsd:complexType._ The
_name_ and _type_ attributes of the mapped element are mapped from the
name and Java type of the public field. The _type_ attribute is derived
from the Java type of the public field using the type mapping rules in
the link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_44250[See Java to XML Type Mapping].

[#50634753_pgfId-1080761]##Each read/write property (as identified by
the _java.beans.Introspector_ class) is mapped to an element in the
_xsd:complexType_ . The _name_ attribute for the mapped element is
derived from the name of the property. The _type_ attribute is mapped
from the Java type of the property using the type mapping specified in
the link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_44250[See Java to XML Type Mapping].

[#50634753_pgfId-1080765]##Inheritance of the Java classes is mapped
using the derivation of _xsd:complexType_ types using the extension
mechanism.

[#50634753_pgfId-1080766]##The only fields that are mapped are the
non-transient, non-final public fields.

[#50634753_pgfId-1098217]##There is no standard mapping of indexed
properties as reported by the JavaBeans introspection.

[#50634753_pgfId-1080769]##There is no standard mapping for the case
when a JavaBean property has the same name as a public field. A Java to
XML mapping implementation is required to flag this case as an error.

[#50634753_pgfId-1080770]##Note that the pluggable serializers and
deserializers may be used to support an advanced custom form of mapping
for the JAX-RPC value types. Such custom mapping may add implementation
specific additional rules over the above standard XML mapping.

======= [#50634753_pgfId-1080771]##Example

[#50634753_pgfId-1080772]##The XML mapping for the _Base_ class is as
shown below:

[#50634753_pgfId-1080778]##</complexType>

[#50634753_pgfId-1080779]##The _Base_ XML type includes elements based
on the mapping of the public field _a_ and the bean property _b_ (mapped
from the pair of _getB_ and _setB_ methods). The private field _c_ and
the method _someMethod_ are not mapped.

[#50634753_pgfId-1080780]##The _Derived_ class is mapped to the
following XML schema type:

===== [#50634753_pgfId-1080792]##Java [#50634753_57839]##Serialization Semantics

[#50634753_pgfId-1095445]##The default serialization semantics (termed
SOAP serialization semantics) and on-wire representation of a JAX-RPC
value type are defined in terms of the XML mapping of a JAX-RPC value
type. Based on the standard XML mapping of a JAX-RPC value type (as
defined in the link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_63973[See XML Mapping]), the
default serialized state for a JAX-RPC value type includes only the XML
mapping of the public fields and bean properties. For example, the
serialized state for the _Base_ value type includes only the public
field _a_ and property _b_ . This XML serialized state gets transmitted
over the wire between the client and service.

[#50634753_pgfId-1080798]##The XML/SOAP serialization semantics and
representation for a JAX-RPC value type differ from the standard Java
serialization. In the standard Java serialization, the serialized state
includes the public, private, protected and package level non-transient
fields for a serializable Java class. RMI-IIOP uses the standard Java
serialization semantics for its value types.

[#50634753_pgfId-1080799]##A JAX-RPC value type is required to conform
to the following set of rules if a JAX-RPC value type requires the Java
serialization semantics. Note that the following rules are in addition
to the rules (in the link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_33043[See JAX-RPC Value
Type]) for a JAX-RPC value type:

[#50634753_pgfId-1095480]##A JAX-RPC value type must implement the
_java.io.Serializable_ interface

[#50634753_pgfId-1080804]##All public fields in the Java class must be
non-transient.

[#50634753_pgfId-1080805]##Each non-public, non-transient field must
exactly represent a JavaBeans property, and vice versa.

[#50634753_pgfId-1088045]##Each non-public field that does not exactly
represent a JavaBeans property must be marked transient.

[#50634753_pgfId-1095497]##A JAX-RPC value type that conforms to the
above rules is usable across both JAX-RPC (with different protocol
bindings) and RMI-IIOP (that uses the standard Java serialization
semantics for its value types) with the same Java serialization
semantics.

[#50634753_pgfId-1096458]##A JAX-RPC value type that implements the
_Serializable_ interface but does not conform to all above rules, may
not have the Java serialization semantics.

XML name. Java identfiers are legal XML names. Note that the SOAP 1.2
specification link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_65269[See W3C: SOAP 1.2:
http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/CR-soap12-part1-20021219/ and
http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/CR-soap12-part2-20021219/] specifies rules for
mapping application defined names to XML names.

===== [#50634753_pgfId-1005246]##Java Package

[#50634753_pgfId-1005261]##A Java package is mapped to a WSDL document.
The mapped WSDL document contains abstract definitions (port type,
operations, messages) based on the mapping of Java declarations in the
corresponding Java package.

[#50634753_pgfId-1005386]##The JAX-RPC specification requires the
namespace definitions in the WSDL document to be mapped in an
application specific manner. A Java to WSDL mapping tool is required to
support the configuration of the namespace definitions in the mapped
WSDL document.

[#50634753_pgfId-1020338]##Note that the Java to WSDL mapping
specification does not require any specific authoring style for the
mapped WSDL document. For example, the mapped WSDL definitions may be
separated into multiple WSDL documents that are imported across
documents.

[#50634753_pgfId-1005385]##A service endpoint interface (that extends
_java.rmi.Remote_ ) is mapped to the _wsdl:portType_ element. The _name_
attribute of the _wsdl:portType_ has the same name as the service
endpoint interface.

[#50634753_pgfId-1005398]##Methods defined in a service endpoint
interface are mapped to the _wsdl:operation_ definitions in the
corresponding _wsdl:portType_ . Refer to the
link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_34399[See Methods] for more details on the
mapping of methods in a service endpoint interface.

======= [#50634753_pgfId-1005423]##Example

[#50634753_pgfId-1005426]##The following shows an example of a service
endpoint interface:

[#50634753_pgfId-1005474]##// Java

[#50634753_pgfId-1005612]##package com.example;

[#50634753_pgfId-1005462]##public interface StockQuoteProvider extends
java.rmi.Remote \{

[#50634753_pgfId-1005463]## float getLastTradePrice(String tickerSymbol)

[#50634753_pgfId-1005464]## throws java.rmi.RemoteException;

[#50634753_pgfId-1005465]##}

[#50634753_pgfId-1005427]##The above service endpoint interface is
mapped to the following _wsdl:portType_ definition. Note that the
_parameterOrder_ attribute is optional based on the WSDL 1.1
specification:

[#50634753_pgfId-1005434]##<!-- WSDL extract -->

[#50634753_pgfId-1005611]##<portType name=”StockQuoteProvider”>

[#50634753_pgfId-1005440]##</portType>

===== [#50634753_pgfId-1005514]##Inherited Service Endpoint interfaces

[#50634753_pgfId-1019992]##Each Java interface in the service endpoint
inheritance hierarchy is mapped to an equivalent _wsdl:portType_
definition. Since the WSDL 1.1 specification does not define a standard
representation for the inheritance of the _wsdl:portType_ elements, each
mapped _wsdl:portType_ definition includes mapping of the complete set
of inherited Java methods. The support for this mapping is optional.

[#50634753_pgfId-1106963]##The following example illustrates this
mapping.

======= [#50634753_pgfId-1005553]##Example

[#50634753_pgfId-1020043]##In the following example, the service
endpoint interfaces _StockQuoteProvider_ and _PremiumStockQuoteProvider_
are mapped to respective _wsdl:portType_ definitions. The port type
_StockQuoteProvider_ includes a single operation _getLastTradePrice_ ;
while the port type _PremiumStockQuoteProvider_ includes two operations
_getLastTradePrice_ and _getRealtimeLastTradePrice_ . The
_getLastTradePrice_ operation in the _PremiumStockQuoteProvider_ port
type is mapped from the corresponding inherited method.

[#50634753_pgfId-1005607]##// Java Code

[#50634753_pgfId-1005606]##package com.example;

===== [#50634753_pgfId-1046189]##[#50634753_34399]##Methods

[#50634753_pgfId-1005384]##Each method on a Java service endpoint
interface is mapped to an equivalent _wsdl:operation_ definition. The
mapped _wsdl:operation_ definition preserves the method signature in
terms of the parameter ordering.

[#50634753_pgfId-1042193]##The standard mapping of a Java method to a
_wsdl:operation_ definitions follows these rules:

[#50634753_pgfId-1097517]##The _name_ attribute of the mapped
_wsdl:operation_ is the same as the name of the Java method.

[#50634753_pgfId-1098138]##Overloaded Java methods are mapped to
multiple _wsdl:operation_ elements. These mapped _wsdl:operation_
elements are named the same (as the name of the overloaded Java methods)
or with unique names depending on the mechanism that is used by the
server-side JAX-RPC runtime system to dispatch methods to the target
service endpoint. For example, a JAX-RPC runtime system may use unique
operation names, _SOAPAction_ or an implementation specific mechanism to
dispatch methods to the target service endpoint. Note that the JAX-RPC
specification does not require use of the _SOAPAction_ .

[#50634753_pgfId-1073545]##A mapped _wsdl:operation_ contains
_wsdl:input_ and, unless it is one-way, _wsdl:output_ and optional
_wsdl:fault_ (s) based on the mapping of the Java method signature. The
_message_ attribute of these _wsdl:input_ and _wsdl:output_ elements
uses the qualified name of the corresponding _wsdl:message_ definition.
Only Java methods with a _void_ return type and that do not throw any
exception other than _java.rmi.RemoteException_ can be mapped to one-way
operations. Since not all Java methods that fulfill this requirement are
amenable to become one-way operations, Java to WSDL mapping tools are
required to provide a facility for specifying metadata used to identify
which of the methods should indeed be mapped to one-way operations.

[#50634753_pgfId-1042197]##Each Java parameter (in the Java method
signature) is mapped to a message part in the _wsdl:message_ . This
_wsdl:message_ corresponds to the _wsdl:input_ element for the mapped
_wsdl:operation_ . Each message part has a _name_ attribute that is
mapped based on the name of the Java parameter and a _type_ attribute
(an XML data type) mapped from the Java type of the parameter. Message
parts appear in the same order as in the Java method signature.

[#50634753_pgfId-1073564]##Refer to the
link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_89214[See Operation Style attribute] for the
requirements related to the mapping of Java methods to the
_soap:operation_ definitions with _document_ and _rpc_ styles in the
SOAP binding.

[#50634753_pgfId-1042201]##Refer to the
link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_43535[See Literal Representation] for details
related to the literal representation of SOAP messages for RPC calls and
responses. In brief, if literal representation is used for the SOAP
message, each message part in the SOAP body references a concrete schema
definition using either the _element_ or _type_ attribute. If the
_element_ attribute is used, the element referenced by the part appears
under the Body element. If the _type_ attribute is used, then the
referenced type becomes the schema type of the element.

[#50634753_pgfId-1042202]##A Java return type (for a Java method) is
mapped to a message part in the _wsdl:message_ . This _wsdl:message_
corresponds to the _wsdl:output_ element for the mapped
_wsdl:operation._ The _name_ of this message part is not significant.

[#50634753_pgfId-1103311]##For _Holder_ classes used as method
parameters, a Java to WSDL mapping tool is required to provide a
facility for specifying the related mapping metadata. This metadata
identifies whether a _Holder_ parameter in the method signature is
mapped to either the _OUT_ or _INOUT_ parameter mode. A mapping tool may
choose to map all _Holder_ parameters to the default _INOUT_ parameter
mode. Future versions of the JAX-RPC specification would consider
specifying a standard approach for specifying such mapping metadata.

[#50634753_pgfId-1042212]##Ordering of Java parameters is represented in
the _parameterOrder_ attribute in the _wsdl:operation_ element. The
message part for a return value is not listed in the _parameterOrder_
attribute. Refer to the WSDL 1.1 specification for more details on the
_parameterOrder_ attribute.

======= [#50634753_pgfId-1100931]##Exceptions

[#50634753_pgfId-1105178]##Each service specific Java exception in a
remote method signature is mapped to a _wsdl:fault_ element. This
_wsdl:fault_ element references a _wsdl:message_ element.

[#50634753_pgfId-1105176]##The _name_ attribute of the _wsdl:message_
element is the same as the name of the Java exception. The _message_
attribute of the _wsdl:fault_ element is the qualified name of the
_wsdl:message_ definition.

[#50634753_pgfId-1110026]##The single message part in the _wsdl:fault_
element (as required by the WSDL 1.1 specification) can refer to either
a type or an element. If it refers to a type, it is either a
_xsd:simpleType_ or a _xsd:complexType_ . If the latter, the _name_
attribute of the _xsd:complexType_ is the same as the name of the Java
exception class. Similarly, if it refers to an element, the _name_
attribute of the _xsd:element_ is the same as the name of the Java
exception class and its type must follow the rules for the mapping to
complex types given in this same section.

[#50634753_pgfId-1110024]##Multiple fields (each with a getter method
and corresponding parameter in the constructor) in the Java exception
class are mapped to elements of the _xsd:complexType_ . The _name_ and
_type_ attribute of each element are mapped from the name and Java type
of the corresponding field in the Java exception class. The mapping of
these fields follows the mapping specified in the
link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_44250[See Java to XML Type Mapping].

[#50634753_pgfId-1105579]##If a Java exception class has a single field
(with a getter method and corresponding parameter in the constructor),
this field is mapped (as an option to the previous bullet) to a single
message part in the _wsdl:message_ . The _name_ and _type_ of this
message _part_ are mapped from the name of Java type of the
corresponding field.

[#50634753_pgfId-1105567]##The _wsdl:message_ part represents the
contents of the _detail_ element in the SOAP fault.

[#50634753_pgfId-1105248]##Inheritance of Java exceptions is mapped
using the derivation of _xsd:complexType_ using the extension mechanism.
This applies to the _xsd:complexType_ used to represent the single
message _part_ in the _wsdl:message_ for the _wsdl:fault_ .

[#50634753_pgfId-1046158]##A remote exception (
_java.rmi.RemoteException_ or its subclasses) is mapped to a standard
SOAP fault. Refer to the link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_51680[See Mapping of
Remote Exceptions] for the standard mapping of remote exceptions.

[#50634753_63057]##SOAP Binding in WSDL

[#50634753_pgfId-1090528]##The _soap:binding_ element in the WSDL
identifies that the SOAP protocol is used for binding the abstract WSDL
definitions.

[#50634753_pgfId-1090529]##The JAX-RPC specification requires support
for the following cases (termed _operation_ _modes_ ) for an operation
with the SOAP binding. Later sections of this chapter specify more
details on these supported operation modes:

[#50634753_pgfId-1090530]##Operation with the _rpc_ style and _encoded_

[#50634753_89214]##Operation Style attribute

[#50634753_pgfId-1090542]##The _style_ attribute (specified per
_soap:operation_ element or as a default in the _soap:binding_ element)
indicates whether an operation is _rpc_ or _document_ oriented. In the
JAX-RPC programming model, both _rpc_ and _document_ style operations
are mapped to the corresponding remote methods on a service endpoint
interface.

[#50634753_pgfId-1090556]##A JAX-RPC client side implementation is
required to support use of services that follow either the WSDL 1.1 or
JAX-RPC (refer to the beginning of this section) specified _document_

specification does not require a wrapper element for the _document_
style operations and assumes the use of _SOAPAction_ .

[#50634753_pgfId-1090557]##The JAX-RPC specification requires that the
above requirements based on the operation style should be hidden from

for _rpc_ style operations with the _encoded_ use. Support for
_document_ style operations with _encoded_ use is optional. In the
_encoded_ use, each message part in the SOAP body references an abstract
type using the _type_ attribute. These types are serialized according to

[#50634753_43535]##Literal Representation

[#50634753_pgfId-1090570]##The JAX-RPC specification requires support
for _rpc_ and _document_ style operations with the _literal_ use. Note
that the _literal_ use is defined on the _soap:body_ element in the
WSDL.

[#50634753_pgfId-1090571]##If the use is _literal_ , each message part
in the SOAP Body element references a concrete schema definition using
either the _element_ or _type_ attribute. If the _element_ attribute is
used, the element referenced by the message part appears under the Body
element (with or without wrapper depending on the operation style). If
the _type_ attribute is used, the type referenced by the part becomes
the schema type of the enclosing element (Body element for the
_document_ style or part accessor element for the _rpc_ style). WSDL 1.1
specification allows (but does not require) use of an optional
_encodingStyle_ attribute for encoding in the literal case.

[#50634753_pgfId-1090572]##The JAX-RPC specification requires support
for the _element_ attribute in a message part with literal
representation and referenced by a _document_ style operation. It also
requires support for the _type_ attribute in a message part with literal
representation and referenced by an _rpc_ style operation. However, use
of any specific encoding style with the literal mode is not required. A
JAX-RPC implementation may use the optional _encodingStyle_ attribute
(in a _soap:body_ element with the _literal_ use) to apply specific
encoding rules.

===== [#50634753_pgfId-1090573]##[#50634753_61828]##Java Mapping of Literal Representation

[#50634753_pgfId-1090574]##The Java mapping for a message part (either a
parameter or return value) with literal representation depends on
whether the JAX-RPC specifies a standard Java mapping for the XML type
of this message part. The link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_83219[See Appendix:
XML Schema Support] specifies a subset of the XML schema data types that
a JAX-RPC implementation is required to support. Refer to the
link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_19087[See XML to Java Type Mapping] for the
specified mapping of this subset of XML schema.

[#50634753_pgfId-1109985]##When mapping _document_ style operations, in
addition to the regular mapping, JAX-RPC implementations are required to
support the so-called “wrapper” style, in which the logical parameters
of an operation are wrapped inside a _xsd:sequence_ element named after
the operation.

[#50634753_pgfId-1111487]##In order to qualify as using the “wrapper”
style, an operation must fulfill the following conditions:

[#50634753_pgfId-1111465]##its input and output messages (if present)
must contain exactly one part;

[#50634753_pgfId-1111476]##such a part must refer to an element named
after the operation;

[#50634753_pgfId-1111488]##such an element (a wrapper) must be of a
complex type defined using the _xsd:sequence_ compositor and containing
only elements declarations.

[#50634753_pgfId-1111498]##In this case, implementations must be able to
discard the wrapper elements and treat their children as the actual
parameters of the operation. Please refer to
link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_15657[See Example] below for an example.

[#50634753_pgfId-1090581]##If there is no standard Java mapping for an
XML schema type, a message part with literal representation is
considered and mapped as a document fragment. The XML to Java mapping
uses the interface _javax.xml.soap.SOAPElement_ to represent a literal
message part in the Java mapping of a _wsdl:operation_ element. For
example, a parameter or a return type (for a remote operation)
represented as a literal message part is mapped to a _SOAPElement_ in
the Java method signature.

[#50634753_pgfId-1090582]##When a _SOAPElement_ is declared and passed
as parameter to the remote method call, the JAX-RPC runtime system
implementation is required to embed the XML representation of the
_SOAPElement_ instance as part of the underlying SOAP message
representation. This embedding of _SOAPElement_ instance is internal to
the implementation of a JAX-RPC runtime system.

[#50634753_pgfId-1109924]##In order to make it possible to use other
data binding frameworks (e.g. JAXB) in conjunction with JAX-RPC, it must
be possible to selectively turn the standard JAX-RPC type mapping off on
a per-part basis and revert to the default mapping, namely _SOAPElement_
. JAX-RPC tools are required to provide a facility to specify metadata
for this purpose.

[#50634753_pgfId-1090586]##Refer to the
link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_97255[See SOAPElement] for more details on the
_SOAPElement_ API.

[#50634753_pgfId-1090587]##Any other form of mapping between the Java
and XML data types for an operation with the literal use is specific to
a JAX-RPC implementation. A portable application should not rely on any
non-standard JAX-RPC implementation specific mapping. For example, a
JAX-RPC implementation may use a Java framework for XML data type
binding to map the literal parts. In this case, each literal part or its
elements is represented by an instance of a Java class generated by the
data binding framework. In the JAX-RPC specification, this form of
mapping is specific to a JAX-RPC implementation. Note that the JAXB 1.0
specification is defining standard Java APIs for the XML data binding.
Future versions of the JAX-RPC specification will consider use of the
JAXB 1.0 APIs.

[#50634753_33689]##SOAP Headerfault

[#50634753_pgfId-1110135]##The _soap:headerfault_ element is used to
specify SOAP header faults, that is, faults pertaining to the processing
of header elements in the message. According to the SOAP specification,
such faults must be carried within the Header element of the SOAP
envelope instead of the Body.

[#50634753_pgfId-1110151]##Unlike _soap:fault_ , which refers to a
_wsdl:fault_ , headerfaults refer directly to a message part. The
JAX-RPC specification only requires support for header faults with
literal use and referring (through their message part) to an
_xsd:element_ . When the header fault is transmitted, this element will
appear within the _SOAP-ENV:Header_ element (and not inside the detail
element of a _SOAP-ENV:Fault_ ), while the _SOAP-ENV:Body_ will contain
a _SOAP-ENV:Fault_ element whose _detail_ is either empty or
unspecified.

[#50634753_pgfId-1110175]##Aside from their different serialization,
SOAP headerfaults may be mapped to Java exceptions in the same way that
regular faults are, with the caveat that the mapping applies only when
the corresponding _soap:header_ has been mapped to a method argument
according to the explicit service context rules (see
link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_49533[See Explicit Service Context]).

Java Types

[#50634753_pgfId-1047197]##A remote method in a Java service endpoint
interface may use the following Java types to represent MIME encoded
content:

[#50634753_pgfId-1047236]##Java classes based on the standard Java
mapping of MIME types. Refer to the section
link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_49417[See Mapping between MIME types and Java
types] for more details.

[#50634753_pgfId-1047209]##Java class _javax.activation.DataHandler_ for
content with any MIME type

[#50634753_pgfId-1047361]##The JAX-RPC specification uses the JavaBeans
Activation Framework link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_86233[See JavaBeans
Activation Framework:
http://java.sun.com/products/javabeans/glasgow/jaf.html] to support
various MIME content types. The _DataHandler_ class provides a
consistent interface to the data represented in various MIME types. A
_DataHandler_ can be instantiated with data and a specific MIME type
using the constructor _DataHandler_ ( _Object_ _obj_ , _String_
_mime_type_ ).

[#50634753_pgfId-1047446]##The data represented by a _DataHandler_ may
be retrieved as a Java object or an _InputStream_ . The method
_DataHandler_ . _getContentType_ returns the MIME type of the
encapsulated data. The _DataHandler.getContent_ method returns a Java
object based on the MIME type of the encapsulated data.

[#50634753_pgfId-1047521]##A _DataHandler_ class uses the

[#50634753_pgfId-1104856]##A JAX-RPC implementation is required to
support mapping between Java and WSDL/XML for remote method calls with
the MIME encoded content.

[#50634753_pgfId-1047442]##A JAX-RPC implementation may use the MIME
binding (as specified in the WSDL 1.1 specification
link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_91453[See Web Services Description Language
(WSDL) 1.1: http://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl]) to support remote method calls
with the MIME encoded content. In the mapped WSDL, MIME elements appear
under _wsdl:input_ and _wsdl:output_ elements in the _wsdl:binding_ .
The _mime_ : _multipartRelated_ element aggregates a set of MIME parts
(or attachment parts) into one message of MIME type "
_multipart/related_ ". The _mime:part_ element describes each attachment
part of such _multipart/related_ message.

[#50634753_pgfId-1103729]##The _mime:content_ elements appear within
each _mime:part_ to specify the concrete MIME type for this part. If
more than one _mime:content_ element appears inside a _mime:part_ ,
these are considered alternatives.

[#50634753_pgfId-1103676]##The _type_ attribute of the _mime:content_
element specifies the MIME type for an attachment part. The _part_
attribute is used to specify the name of the message part. The _type_
attribute may use _*_ wild cards to specify a set of acceptable MIME
types. An example is _image/*_ for all image types.

[#50634753_pgfId-1103630]##The _parts_ attribute in the _wsdl:input_ and
_wsdl:output_ elements (defined per _operation_ in the _wsdl:binding_ )
lists parts that appear in the SOAP body portion of the message. The
unlisted parts of a message appear in the attachment parts of the SOAP
message in the case of the _multipart/related_ MIME binding.

option to map the above set of MIME types to the
_javax.activation.DataHandler_ class. The _DataHandler_ class provides
methods to get access to the stream representation of the data for a
MIME type.

[#50634753_pgfId-1103950]##A Java to WSDL mapping tool is required to
provide a facility for specifying metadata related to the above mapping

metadata identifies a specific mapping.

[#50634753_pgfId-1094461]##If a MIME type is mapped to the

[#50634753_pgfId-1072473]##A WSDL to Java mapping tool generates a stub
class during the import of a service described in a WSDL document. The
JAX-RPC specification does not require that a stub class be generated
only through the mapping of a WSDL document. For example, a stub class
may be generated using a service endpoint interface and additional
information about the protocol binding.

[#50634753_pgfId-1072400]##All generated stub classes are required to
implement the _javax.xml.rpc.Stub_ interface. An instance of a stub
class represents a client side proxy or stub instance for the target

[#50634753_pgfId-1072457]##A generated stub class is required to
implement a service endpoint interface. The name of a generated stub
class is either _<BindingName>_Stub_ or is implementation specific. In
the former case, the name of the generated stub class is derived from
the _name_ attribute of the corresponding _wsdl:binding_ element in the
imported WSDL service description. The _wsdl:binding_ element binds an
abstract _wsdl:portType_ to a specific protocol and transport.

[#50634753_pgfId-1088100]##Note that the JAX-RPC specification does not
require that a generated stub class be binding and transport neutral. A
stub class should be bound to a specific protocol and transport.

===== [#50634753_pgfId-1056770]##[#50634753_72254]##Dynamic Proxy

[#50634753_pgfId-1039299]##The JAX-RPC specification requires support
for the dynamic proxy for invoking a service endpoint. A dynamic proxy
class supports a service endpoint interface dynamically at runtime
without requiring any code generation of a stub class that implements a
specific service endpoint interface.

[#50634753_pgfId-1039295]##Refer to the J2SE
link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_70636[See J2SE: http://java.sun.com/j2se/]
documentation for more details on the dynamic proxy APIs
_java.lang.reflect.Proxy_ and _java.lang.reflect.InvocationHandler_ .

[#50634753_pgfId-1034346]##The _getPort_ method on the
_javax.xml.rpc.Service_ interface provide support for the creation of a
dynamic proxy. The serviceEndpointInterface parameter specifies the
service endpoint interface that is supported by the created dynamic
proxy. The service endpoint interface must conform to the JAX-RPC
specification.:

[#50634753_pgfId-1068162]##package javax.xml.rpc;

[#50634753_pgfId-1068163]##public interface Service \{

[#50634753_pgfId-1068165]## java.rmi.Remote getPort(QName portName,

[#50634753_pgfId-1068166]## Class serviceEndpointInterface)

[#50634753_pgfId-1033755]## // ...

[#50634753_pgfId-1065216]##}

[#50634753_pgfId-1103391]##This method throws _ServiceException_ if
there is an error in creation of the dynamic proxy or if there is any
missing WSDL related metadata that is required. The JAX-RPC
specification does not require that the _getPort_ method fully validate
the passed serviceEndpointInterface against the corresponding WSDL
definitions. A JAX-RPC implementation may choose to perform either lazy
or eager validation in an implementation specific manner.

[#50634753_pgfId-1098648]##A dynamic proxy is required to also support
the _javax.xml.rpc.Stub_ interface. This provides support for the
configuration of a dynamic proxy. Refer to the
link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_21802[See Stub Configuration] for additional
details.

======= [#50634753_pgfId-1063916]##Example

[#50634753_pgfId-1063917]##The following example shows the use of a
dynamic proxy for invoking an operation on the target service endpoint.

[#50634753_pgfId-1056414]##The _javax.xml.rpc.Call_ interface provides
support for the dynamic invocation of an operation on the target service
endpoint. The _javax.xml.rpc.Service_ interface acts as a factory for
the creation of _Call_ instances.

[#50634753_pgfId-1065224]##A client side JAX-RPC runtime system
implementation is required to implement the _Call_ interface.

[#50634753_pgfId-1068181]##The _createCall_ method on the _Service_
interface may create a _Call_ object with an internal implementation
specific in-memory model of the WSDL description of the service. The
_portName_ in the _createCall_ method identifies the target service
endpoint.

[#50634753_pgfId-1068182]##The _createCall_ method with no parameters
creates an empty _Call_ object that needs to be configured using the
setter methods on the _Call_ interface.

[#50634753_pgfId-1055795]##Once a _Call_ instance is created, various
setter and getter methods are used to configure this _Call_ instance.
The configuration of a _Call_ instance includes the following:

[#50634753_pgfId-1055796]##Name of a specific operation

[#50634753_pgfId-1087256]##Port type for the target service endpoint

[#50634753_pgfId-1073261]##Address of the target service endpoint

[#50634753_pgfId-1055799]##Properties specific to the binding to a
protocol and transport: example, SOAPAction URI for the SOAP binding to
HTTP. The standard properties are specified later in this section.

[#50634753_pgfId-1055800]##Name, type and mode ( _IN_ , _INOUT_ , _OUT_
) of the parameters. These properties are optional.

[#50634753_pgfId-1074433]##Return type

[#50634753_pgfId-1101068]##A setter method should throw
_javax.xml.rpc.JAXRPCException_ in the following cases:

[#50634753_pgfId-1101055]##If an optional standard property name is
specified, however this _Call_ implementation class does not support the
configuration of this property.

[#50634753_pgfId-1101056]##If an invalid or unsupported property name is
specified or if a value of mismatched property type is passed. An
example is an illegal property name with the standard property name
prefix _javax.xml.rpc_ .

[#50634753_pgfId-1101057]##If there is any error in the configuration of
a valid property.

[#50634753_pgfId-1101058]##Note that a setter method may not check
validity of a configured property value. An example is the standard
property for the target service endpoint address that is not checked for
validity. In this case, any configuration errors are detected at the
invoke time.

[#50634753_pgfId-1080561]##In terms of the specification of parameters
and return value, a _Call_ implementation class is required to support
the following cases:

[#50634753_pgfId-1068186]##The _Call_ implementation class determines
the types of the parameters and return value from the invocation of
_addParameter_ and _setReturnType_ methods in the client code. The
method _isParameterAndReturnSpecRequired_ is required to return _true_
in this case.

[#50634753_pgfId-1056475]##The _Call_ implementation class determines
the types and modes of the parameters in an implementation specific
manner. For example, a _Call_ implementation class may determine
parameter types by using Java reflection on parameters, using WSDL
service description and the configured type mapping registry. In this
case, the client code is not required to invoke any _addParameter_ and
_setReturnType_ methods before calling the _invoke_ method. The method
_isParameterAndReturnSpec-Required_ is required to return _false_ in
this case. The methods _addParameter_ , _removeAllParameters_ and
_setReturnType_ may throw _JAXRPCException_ if invoked in this case.

====== [#50634753_pgfId-1056464]##Invocation Modes

[#50634753_pgfId-1056515]##The _Call_ implementation class is required
to support the following invocation modes:

[#50634753_pgfId-1057576]##Synchronous request-response mode: The
_invoke_ method calls a specified operation using a synchronous
request-response interaction mode. The _invoke_ method takes as
parameters the object values corresponding to the parameter types. The
implementation of the _invoke_ method checks whether the passed
parameter values match the number, order and types of parameters
specified in the corresponding WSDL specification of the same operation.
The _invoke_ method is required to throw exception _java.rmi_ .
_RemoteException_ if there is any error in the remote method invocation.
The method throws _JAXRPCException_ if the _Call_ object is not
configured properly or if parameters and return type are incorrectly
specified.

[#50634753_pgfId-1057583]##One-way mode: The _invokeOneWay_ method
invokes a remote method using the one-way interaction mode. The client
thread does not block waiting for the completion of the processing of
this remote method invocation on the service endpoint. When the protocol
in use is SOAP/HTTP, the client should block until an HTTP response code
has been received or an error occurs. Reception of a response code
simply means that the transmission of the request is complete, and not
that the request was accepted or processed. This method must not throw
any remote exceptions. This method is required to throw a
_JAXRPCException_ if there is an error in the configuration of the
_Call_ object (example: a non-void return type has been incorrectly
specified for the one-way call) or if there is any error during the
invocation of the one-way remote call.

[#50634753_pgfId-1080568]##The method _getOutputParams_ returns a
_java.util.Map_ of \{name, value} for the output parameters for the last
invoked operation. The parameter names in the returned _Map_ are of the
type _java.lang.String_ . The type of a value depends on the mapping
between the Java and XML types. This method is required to throw
_JAXRPCException_ if invoked for a one-way operation or if invoked
before any _invoke_ method has been called.

[#50634753_pgfId-1103920]##The method _getOutputValues_ returns a list
(of Java type _java.util.List_ ) of values for the output parameters.
This method is required to throw _JAXRPCException_ if invoked for a
one-way operation or if invoked before any _invoke_ method has been
called.

====== [#50634753_pgfId-1063929]##Standard Properties

[#50634753_pgfId-1073494]##The JAX-RPC specification specifies a
standard set of properties that may be passed to the _Call_ .
_setProperty_ method. A _Call_ implementation class may also support
additional set of properties. However, the specification of these
additional properties is out of scope for JAX-RPC.

[#50634753_pgfId-1073490]##The names and types of these properties are
as follows. The following table also specifies whether or not a _Call_
implementation is required to support a specific standard property:

[#50634753_73562]##Requirements

[#50634753_pgfId-1055340]##The JAX-RPC specification specifies the
following requirements for the service client programming model:

[#50634753_pgfId-1055341]##Service client programming model must be
independent of how a service endpoint is realized on the server side. A
service client must invoke a service endpoint using the same client
programming model irrespective of whether a service endpoint has been
defined on the J2EE platform or on a non-Java platform.

[#50634753_pgfId-1055342]##Service client environment should be capable
of importing a WSDL document and generating a Java based client side
representation for a service described in this document. A client side
representation includes classes generated based on the mapping of the
WSDL definitions to the corresponding Java representation.

[#50634753_pgfId-1055343]##Service client programming model must not be
exposed or tied to a specific protocol, transport or any JAX-RPC
implementation specific mechanism. For example, a JAX-RPC service client
should not be exposed to how a JAX-RPC client side runtime system
invokes a remote method using a specific implementation level
interaction mode and connection management.

[#50634753_pgfId-1055344]##The JAX-RPC specification does not address
discovery of a JAX-RPC service from a service registry. A JAX-RPC
implementation is not required to support the Java APIs for XML
Registries (JAXR 1.0).

==== [#50634753_pgfId-1068192]##

[#50634753_98773]##J2EE based Service Client Programming Model

[#50634753_pgfId-1091958]##

image:jaxrpc-12.gif[image]

This section is non-prescriptive and is not required to be implemented
by a client side JAX-RPC 1.1 implementation. The standard JAX-RPC client
programming model for J2EE would be specified in the JSR-109, J2EE 1.4,
EJB 2.1 and Servlet 2.4 specifications. This section provides input to
these specifications.

image:jaxrpc-12.gif[image]

[#50634753_pgfId-1091942]##This section describes the programming
interface and deployment descriptor that allows a J2EE component (either
a servlet, EJB) or a J2EE application client to act as a service client
and invoke a service endpoint. The programming model approach in this
section is consistent with the J2EE programming model for looking up
external resources.

===== [#50634753_pgfId-1068195]##Component Provider

[#50634753_pgfId-1068196]##The component provider references an external
service using a logical name called service reference. The component
provider uses the service reference to get access to the service ports
as follows:

[#50634753_pgfId-1068197]##The component provider assigns an entry in
the component’s environment to the service reference. The component
provider uses the deployment descriptor to declare a service reference.
Refer to the next section for more details on the deployment descriptor.

[#50634753_pgfId-1068198]##The component provider looks up an instance
of a service class using the JNDI namespace. Refer to the
link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_95029[See WSDL Service] for the details on the
service class. Note that the service class should implement the
_javax.naming_ . _Referenceable_ and/or _java.io.Serializable_ interface
to support registration and lookup from the JNDI namespace.

[#50634753_pgfId-1068202]##The component provider uses an appropriate
method on the looked up service instance to get one or more proxy
objects for the target service endpoint. A proxy for a service endpoint
can be either a dynamic proxy or an instance of a generated stub class
or a _javax.xml.rpc.Call_ object.

======= [#50634753_pgfId-1068204]##Example

[#50634753_pgfId-1068205]##The following code snippet illustrates how a
component provider looks up a service, gets a stub instance for a
service endpoint and invokes a remote method on the service endpoint:

======= [#50634753_pgfId-1068207]##[#50634753_31215]##J2EE Programming Model: Getting a stub instance

[#50634753_pgfId-1068208]## Context ctx = new InitialContext();

[#50634753_pgfId-1068209]## com.example.StockQuoteService sqs =

[#50634753_pgfId-1068210]##
ctx.lookup(“java:comp/env/StockQuoteService”);

[#50634753_pgfId-1073819]## com.example.StockQuoteProvider sqp =

[#50634753_pgfId-1073817]## sqs.getStockQuoteProviderPort();

[#50634753_pgfId-1068212]## float quotePrice =
sqp.getLastTradePrice(“ACME”);

[#50634753_pgfId-1068213]##In the typical case, the component provider
calls the getter method on the service ( _getStockQuoteProviderPort_
method in the above example) with no parameters. Refer to the
link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_73614[See An example service endpoint
interface] and link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_51386[See Example of a Generated
Service Interface: StockQuoteService] for the code snippets for
_StockQuoteProvider_ and _StockQuoteService_ .

[#50634753_pgfId-1068220]##The following example shows the creation of a
dynamic proxy.

======= [#50634753_pgfId-1068222]##[#50634753_15179]##J2EE Programming Model: Creating a dynamic proxy

[#50634753_pgfId-1068223]## Context ctx = new InitialContext();

[#50634753_pgfId-1068224]## javax.xml.rpc.Service sqs = ctx.lookup(

[#50634753_pgfId-1068225]## “java:comp/env/DynamicService”);

[#50634753_pgfId-1068226]## com.example.StockQuoteProvider sqp =

[#50634753_pgfId-1068227]## (com.example.StockQuoteProvider)sqs.getPort(

[#50634753_pgfId-1068230]## float quotePrice =
sqp.getLastTradePrice(“ACME”);

[#50634753_pgfId-1068231]##Note that the JAX-RPC specification does not
specify a standard JNDI subcontext for the service references.

===== [#50634753_pgfId-1068232]##Deployment Descriptor

[#50634753_pgfId-1068233]##The component provider declares all the
service references in the deployment descriptor (for a specific J2EE
component) using the _service-ref_ element. Each _service-ref_ contains
the following elements:

[#50634753_pgfId-1068234]## _description_ : This element describes the
referenced service. This information is meant for the deployer.

[#50634753_pgfId-1068235]## _service-ref-name_ : The name of the logical
reference used in the component code. This name is relative to the
_java:comp/env_ subcontext. For example, the name is _StockQuoteService_
in the link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_31215[See J2EE Programming Model:
Getting a stub instance] rather than the
_java:comp/env/StockQuoteService_ .

[#50634753_pgfId-1090865]## _service-ref-type_ : This element indicates
the fully qualified name of the service class returned by the JNDI
lookup. The link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_31215[See J2EE Programming Model:
Getting a stub instance] has _com.example. StockQuoteService_ as the
_service-ref-type_ , while the link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_15179[See J2EE
Programming Model: Creating a dynamic proxy] has _javax.xml.rpc.Service_
as the _service-ref-type_ .

[#50634753_pgfId-1090868]## _type-mapping_ : This optional element
specifies the requirements for the pluggable serializers and
deserializers.

===== [#50634753_pgfId-1068249]##Deployer

[#50634753_pgfId-1068250]##The deployer performs the following steps for
each service reference declared in a component’s deployment descriptor:

[#50634753_pgfId-1068251]##The deployer links a service reference to the
actual representation and configuration of the corresponding service.
Such linking of a service reference is specific to the implementation of
a container. For example, the deployer may choose to link the logical
service reference to the imported WSDL based description of the service.
However, JAX-RPC does not mandate any specific linking mechanism.

[#50634753_pgfId-1068252]##The deployer also provides and configures
required configuration information for the service instance and service
endpoint proxies. For example, this configuration information includes
target endpoint address, properties specific to a protocol and
underlying transport, security information and type mapping registry.

[#50634753_pgfId-1068253]##The deployer ensures that the configuration
of a service and service proxy is based on the protocol binding
specified in the WSDL description of this service. Refer to the
link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_21802[See Stub Configuration] for more details.

J2SE based Service Client Programming Model

[#50634753_pgfId-1068272]##A J2SE based service client uses one of the
following approaches for the invocation of a JAX-RPC service endpoint:

[#50634753_pgfId-1092018]##The service client uses the generated stub
classes. A WSDL to Java mapping tool imports a WSDL based service
description and maps it to the corresponding client side Java
representation. The generated client side artifacts may include
serializers, deserializers, holders and utility classes.

[#50634753_pgfId-1068274]##The service client uses the
_javax.xml.rpc.Service_ interface to create a dynamic proxy for the
target service endpoint.

[#50634753_pgfId-1099417]##The service client uses the
_javax.xml.rpc.Service_ interface to create a _Call_ object. Next, the
service client uses the _javax.xml.rpc.Call_ interface to dynamically
invoke an operation on the target service endpoint.

Service Developer

[#50634753_pgfId-1089828]##This section specifies the role of a service
developer in the definition of a servlet based JAX-RPC service endpoint
component.

[#50634753_pgfId-1089829]##First, the service developer performs one of
the following steps depending on whether or not the service developer
has the WSDL document for a service endpoint:

[#50634753_pgfId-1089830]##The service developer generates a service
endpoint interface from a WSDL document using a WSDL to Java mapping
tool. Refer to the link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_51248[See WSDL to Java
Mapping] for more details.

[#50634753_pgfId-1089834]##The service developer defines a service
endpoint interface that conforms to the specification in the
link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_36514[See JAX-RPC Service Endpoint Interface].
In this case, the developer may not have the WSDL document for this
service.

[#50634753_pgfId-1089838]##Next, the service developer develops a
service endpoint component by providing a service endpoint class as
follows:

[#50634753_pgfId-1089839]##The service endpoint class is required to
implement a service endpoint interface.

[#50634753_pgfId-1089840]##The service endpoint class is required to
have a default public constructor.

[#50634753_pgfId-1097135]##The service endpoint class may implement the
_ServiceLifecycle_ interface. Refer to the
link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_78984[See JAX-RPC Service Endpoint Lifecycle]
for more details on the lifecycle of the JAX-RPC service endpoint class.

[#50634753_pgfId-1089845]##The service endpoint class is allowed to
obtain references to resources and enterprise beans by using JNDI to
lookup these resources. The deployment elements ( _env-entry_ ,
_ejb-ref_ , _ejb-local-ref_ , _resource-ref_ and _resource-env-ref_ )
are specified in the web application deployment descriptor. Refer to the
Servlet 2.3 and J2EE 1.3 specifications for more details on the web
application environment that is also available to the service endpoint
class.

===== [#50634753_pgfId-1089847]##[#50634753_78984]##JAX-RPC Service Endpoint Lifecycle

[#50634753_pgfId-1089848]##The service endpoint class may implement the
following _ServiceLifecycle_ interface:

[#50634753_pgfId-1089849]##package javax.xml.rpc.server;

[#50634753_pgfId-1089850]##public interface ServiceLifecycle \{

[#50634753_pgfId-1089851]## void init(Object context) throws
ServiceException;

[#50634753_pgfId-1089852]## void destroy();

[#50634753_pgfId-1089853]##}

[#50634753_pgfId-1089854]##If the service endpoint class implements the
_ServiceLifeycle_ interface, the servlet container based JAX-RPC runtime
system is required to manage the lifecycle of the corresponding service
endpoint instances. The lifecycle of a service endpoint instance is
realized through the implementation of the _init_ and _destroy_ methods
of the _ServiceLifecycle_ interface.

[#50634753_pgfId-1089855]##The JAX-RPC runtime system is responsible for
loading and instantiation of service endpoint instances. The JAX-RPC
runtime system may choose to load and instantiate a service endpoint
instance during the startup of the runtime system or when a service
endpoint instance is needed to service an RPC request. The JAX-RPC
runtime system loads the service endpoint class using the Java class
loading facility. After service endpoint class is loaded, the JAX-RPC
runtime system instantiates the class.

[#50634753_pgfId-1102687]##After the service endpoint instance is
instantiated, the JAX-RPC runtime system is required to initialize the
endpoint instance before any requests can be serviced. The JAX-RPC
runtime system is required to invoke the _ServiceLifecycle_ . _init_
method (if this interface is implemented by the endpoint class) for the
initialization of the service endpoint instance. The service endpoint
instance uses the _init_ method to initialize its configuration and
setup access to any external resources. The _context_ parameter in the
_init_ method enables the endpoint instance to access the endpoint
context provided by the underlying JAX-RPC runtime system.

[#50634753_pgfId-1106225]##Once a service endpoint instance has been
initialized (and in a method ready state), the JAX-RPC runtime system
may dispatch multiple remote method invocations to the service endpoint
instance. These method invocations must correspond to the remote methods
in the service endpoint interface implemented by the service endpoint
class.

[#50634753_pgfId-1106290]##Instances of a specific service endpoint
class are considered equivalent when not servicing a client invoked
remote method invocation. A service endpoint instance does not maintain
any client specific state across remote method invocations. So service
endpoint instances are capable of pooling by the JAX-RPC runtime system.
The JAX-RPC runtime system can invoke a remote method on any available
and method ready instances of a specific service endpoint class.

[#50634753_pgfId-1089857]##The JAX-RPC runtime system is required to
invoke the _destroy_ method when the runtime system determines that the
service endpoint instance needs to be removed from service of handling
remote invocations. For example, the JAX-RPC runtime may remove an
endpoint instance from service when the runtime system is shutting down
or managing memory resources.

[#50634753_pgfId-1102756]##The service endpoint class releases its
resources and performs cleanup in the implementation of the _destroy_
method.

[#50634753_pgfId-1102763]##After successful invocation of the _destroy_
method, a service endpoint instance is ready for garbage collection. The
JAX-RPC runtime system should not dispatch any remote method invocations
to a destroyed endpoint instance. The JAX-RPC runtime system is required
to instantiate and initialize a new service endpoint instance for
servicing new remote method invocations.

===== [#50634753_pgfId-1102094]##Servlet based Endpoint

[#50634753_pgfId-1102829]##During the deployment of a service endpoint
component on a servlet container based JAX-RPC runtime system, a service
endpoint class is associated with a servlet. The associated servlet
class is provided by the JAX-RPC runtime system (not by service endpoint
developer) during the deployment. This association is configured in a
manner specific to a JAX-RPC runtime system and its deployment tool. For
example, a JAX-RPC deployment tool may configure a 1-1 association
between a servlet class and service endpoint class. The associated
servlet class corresponds to the configured transport binding for the
service endpoint. For example, the servlet class
_javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet_ is used for the HTTP transport.

[#50634753_pgfId-1102950]##The associated servlet typically takes the
responsibility of handling transport specific processing of an RPC
request and for initiating dispatch to the target service endpoint
instance. Each _Servlet_ . _service_ method maps to a single remote
method invocation on the target service endpoint instance. The thread
model (whether single threaded or concurrent) for the remote method
invocation on the service endpoint instance depends on the runtime
system specific servlet associated with the corresponding endpoint
class. The Servlet specification link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_71367[See J2EE
Specifications: http://java.sun.com/j2ee/] provides facility for both
concurrent and single threaded model (the latter through the
_SingleThreadModel_ interface) for the _service_ method on a servlet.

[#50634753_pgfId-1110285]##When processing an incoming SOAP request for
a one-way operation, the associated servlet is required to send back an
HTTP response code of 200 or 202 as soon as it has identified the
incoming request as being one-way and before it dispatches it to the
target service endpoint instance.

===== [#50634753_pgfId-1102821]##ServletEndpointContext

[#50634753_pgfId-1102100]##For service endpoint components deployed on a
servlet container based JAX-RPC runtime system, the _context_ parameter
in the _ServiceLifecycle_ . _init_ method is required to be of the Java
type _javax.xml.rpc.server.ServletEndpointContext_ . The
_ServletEndpoint Context_ provides an endpoint context maintained by the
underlying servlet container based JAX-RPC runtime system.

[#50634753_pgfId-1102280]##Note that the JAX-RPC specification specifies
the standard programming model for a servlet based endpoint. The goal of
JAX-RPC specification is not to define a more generic abstraction for
the endpoint context or session that is independent of any specific
component model, container and protocol binding. Such generic
abstractions and endpoint model are outside the scope of the JAX-RPC
specification.

[#50634753_pgfId-1102103]##The following code snippet shows the
_ServletEndpointContext_ interface.

[#50634753_pgfId-1102125]##package javax.xml.rpc.server;

[#50634753_pgfId-1102095]##A servlet container based JAX-RPC runtime
system is required to implement the _ServletEndpointContext_ interface.
The JAX-RPC runtime system is required to provide appropriate session,
message context, servlet context and user principal information per
method invocation on service endpoint instances.

[#50634753_pgfId-1102799]##The _getHttpSession_ method returns the
current HTTP session (as a _javax.servlet. http.HTTPSession_ ). When
invoked by the service endpoint instance within a remote method
implementation, the _getHttpSession_ returns the HTTP session associated
currently with this method invocation. This method is required to return
_null_ if there is no HTTP session currently active and associated with
this service endpoint instance. An endpoint class should not rely on an
active HTTP session being always there; the underlying JAX-RPC runtime
system is responsible for managing whether or not there is an active
HTTP session.

[#50634753_pgfId-1102214]##The _getHttpSession_ method throws
_JAXRPCException_ if it is invoked by a non HTTP bound endpoint. The
JAX-RPC specification does not specify any transport level session
abstraction for non-HTTP bound endpoints.

[#50634753_pgfId-1102232]##The method _getMessageContext_ returns the
_MessageContext_ targeted for this endpoint instance per remote method
invocation. This enables the service endpoint instance to access the
_MessageContext_ propagated by request _HandlerChain_ (and its contained
_Handler_ instances) to the target endpoint instance and to share any
SOAP message processing related context. The endpoint instance can
access and manipulate the _MessageContext_ and share the SOAP message
processing related context with the response _HandlerChain_ . Refer to
the link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_33935[See JAX-RPC Handler APIs] for more
details on the SOAP message handler APIs.

[#50634753_pgfId-1102251]##The JAX-RPC runtime system is required to set
the appropriate _MessageContext_ based on the _HandlerChain_ associated
with the target endpoint. If there is no associated _MessageContext_ ,
this method returns _null_ . The _getMessageContext_ method is required
to throw the _java.lang.IllegalStateException_ if this method is invoked
outside a remote method implementation by an endpoint class.

[#50634753_pgfId-1102268]##The method _getServletContext_ returns the
_ServletContext_ associated with the web application that contain this
endpoint. According to the Servlet specification, there is one context
per web application (deployed as a _WAR_ ) per JVM. A servlet based
service endpoint component is deployed as part of a web application.

[#50634753_pgfId-1102296]##The method _getUserPrincipal_ returns a
_java.security.Principal_ instance that contains the name of the
authenticated user for the current method invocation on the endpoint
instance. This method returns _null_ if there is no associated principal
yet. The underlying JAX-RPC runtime system takes the responsibility of
providing the appropriate authenticated principal for a remote method
invocation on the service endpoint instance.

[#50634753_pgfId-1109514]##The method _isUserInRole_ returns a _boolean_
indicating whether the authenticated user for the current method
invocation on the endpoint instance is included in the specified logical
“role”. This method returns false if the user has not been
authenticated. The determination of whether the authenticated user is
included in the specified role must be carried out according to the
Servlet specification.

Packaging and Deployment Model

[#50634753_pgfId-1099285]##The JAX-RPC specification does not specify
any normative model for packaging and deployment of service endpoints on
a servlet container based JAX-RPC runtime system. A JAX-RPC 1.1
implementation is allowed to have a vendor-specific deployment and
packaging model for servlet based service endpoints.

[#50634753_pgfId-1099300]##The J2EE 1.4 specification

[#50634753_66333]##Service Context

image:jaxrpc-4.gif[image]

[#50634753_pgfId-1035656]##The JAX-RPC specification allows service
context to be associated with a remote call to a service endpoint. For
example, a service context may carry information corresponding to the
SOAP header entries.

[#50634753_pgfId-1092148]##This chapter describes the client programming
model for the management and processing of service context. Note that
the JAX-RPC specification does not (nor intends to, in future) specify
the semantic content of the service contexts.

[#50634753_pgfId-1092144]##This chapter describes non-prescriptive
guidelines for the mapping of the service context.

==== [#50634753_pgfId-1038001]##

image:jaxrpc-5.gif[image]

Context Definition

[#50634753_pgfId-1040702]##The concrete format of the service context
and its transmission between a service client and service endpoint
depends on the protocol binding associated with the JAX-RPC call. For
example, if SOAP over HTTP binding is used, the service context is
transmitted in the SOAP Header. Another example is Basic Authentication
information that is carried in the HTTP request header.

[#50634753_pgfId-1040714]##The JAX-RPC programming model is independent
of whether service context is carried in the XML based protocol or the
underlying transport.

[#50634753_pgfId-1040706]##Note that the SOAP specification
link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_73033[See W3C Note: SOAP 1.1:
http://www.w3.org/TR/SOAP/] does not define any standard formats for the
SOAP headers. Refer to the link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_24046[See
Interoperability] for the implication of service context propagation on
the interoperability.

[#50634753_pgfId-1038002]##The WSDL 1.1 specification includes a
_soap:header_ element in the SOAP binding. A _soap:header_ element
defines an header entry transmitted in the SOAP Header. Multiple
_soap:header_ elements can be defined per operation for both input and
output. Note that the WSDL 1.1 specification does not require that SOAP
headers be listed exhaustively in the SOAP binding.

[#50634753_pgfId-1038003]##An exported WSDL document (for a JAX-RPC
service endpoint definition) includes _soap:header_ elements for both
input and output of each operation. These _soap:header_ elements may be
defined specific to either a service endpoint definition or a JAX-RPC
runtime system or a server-side J2EE container.

[#50634753_pgfId-1038004]##On the service client side, a WSDL to Java
mapping tool maps _soap:header_ elements to either implicit or explicit
service context. A client side JAX-RPC runtime system or generated stub
class may add service context for a remote method call. This service
context information is in addition to that specified in the WSDL defined
_soap:header_ elements.

Programming Model

[#50634753_pgfId-1035742]##The JAX-RPC specification classifies service
context as follows based on the JAX-RPC programming model:

[#50634753_pgfId-1035743]##Implicit service context

[#50634753_pgfId-1035744]##Explicit service context

===== [#50634753_pgfId-1035738]##Implicit Service Context

[#50634753_pgfId-1035668]##This form of service context is managed and
propagated implicitly by generated stubs or client and server side
JAX-RPC runtime systems. A service client or service implementation does
not need to programmatically manage an implicit service context.

======= [#50634753_pgfId-1035682]##Example

[#50634753_pgfId-1036098]##A J2EE container with the JAX-RPC runtime
system implicitly propagates the security context with a remote method
invocation. The propagation of the security context does not require any
explicit programming by the service client.

===== [#50634753_pgfId-1035591]##[#50634753_49533]##Explicit Service Context

[#50634753_pgfId-1035758]##Explicit service context is represented in
the form of additional parameters appended following the service
endpoint defined parameters in the remote method signature. The type of
a service context parameter depends on whether the service context is of
_IN_ , _OUT_ or _INOUT_ type. Explicit service context is typically used
to represent application specific service context.

[#50634753_pgfId-1040764]##An explicit service context parameter may be
either based on the mapping of a _soap:header_ element in the WSDL
service description or generated specific to a client-side JAX-RPC
implementation. The name of the Java method parameter is mapped from the
_name_ of the _part_ referenced in the _soap:header_ element. If a
_soap:header_ is mapped to a Java method argument, and only in this
case, any of its _soap:headerfault_ (s) may be mapped to service
specific exceptions (see link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_33689[See SOAP
Headerfault]).

[#50634753_pgfId-1103331]##A Java to WSDL mapping tool is required to
provide a facility for specifying metadata related to the mapping of the
explicit service context. This metadata identifies whether a specific
parameter or return type in the Java method signature is mapped to a
SOAP header element instead of an element in the SOAP body. Future
versions of the JAX-RPC specification would consider specifying a
standard approach for the specification of such mapping metadata.

======= [#50634753_pgfId-1037829]##Example

[#50634753_pgfId-1037652]##The following Java interface shows example of
an explicit service context. In this example, the _context_ is a service
context parameter appended after the service defined parameters of the
_getStockQuote_ method. This context parameter is of _inout_ type and is
mapped to a _Holder_ class. The generated stub class for this service
endpoint interface represents this _context_ parameter as a SOAP header
entry:

[#50634753_pgfId-1037641]##package com.example;

[#50634753_pgfId-1037642]##public interface StockQuoteProvider extends
java.rmi.Remote \{

[#50634753_pgfId-1037643]## // Method returns last trade price

[#50634753_pgfId-1037644]## float getStockQuote(String tickerSymbol,
StringHolder context)

[#50634753_pgfId-1037648]## throws java.rmi.RemoteException;

[#50634753_pgfId-1037649]##}

[#50634753_pgfId-1037826]##Since processing of a SOAP header can
generate SOAP faults, a method with an explicit context parameter may
throw a _javax.xml.rpc.soap.SOAPFaultException_ that extends the
_java.lang.RuntimeException_ .

Processing of Service Context

[#50634753_pgfId-1039243]##A JAX-RPC runtime system should be capable of
processing both inbound or outbound service contexts. A J2EE container
based JAX-RPC runtime system typically processes the infrastructure
related service context. Examples are transaction and security contexts.
The JAX-RPC runtime system uses the container provided services
(example: transaction manager) to process the service context.

[#50634753_pgfId-1094063]##The processing of an inbound service context
depends on the semantics of the service context and also on the consumer
of the service context-whether context consumer is server-side JAX-RPC
runtime system, J2EE container or the target service endpoint
implementation.

[#50634753_pgfId-1094049]##The JAX-RPC specification does not specify
any standard server-side model for the processing of the service
context.

[#50634753_73719]##SOAP Message Handlers

image:jaxrpc-4.gif[image]

[#50634753_pgfId-1106113]##This chapter specifies the requirements and
APIs for SOAP message handlers. A SOAP message handler gets access to
the SOAP message that represents either an RPC request or response. A
typical use of a SOAP message handler is to process the SOAP header
blocks as part of the processing of an RPC request or response. A few
typical examples of handlers are:

[#50634753_pgfId-1106114]##Encryption and decryption handler

[#50634753_pgfId-1106115]##Logging and auditing handler

[#50634753_pgfId-1105175]##Caching handler

[#50634753_pgfId-1106141]##SOAP message handlers are tied to web service
endpoints (either on client or server) and are used to provide
additional SOAP message processing facility as an extension to these
components.

[#50634753_pgfId-1106139]##An example of a SOAP message handler is as
follows:

[#50634753_pgfId-1083061]##A secure stock quote service requires that
the SOAP body be encrypted and the SOAP message digitally signed to
prevent any unauthorized access or tampering with the RPC requests or
responses for this service. A SOAP message handler on the service client
side encrypts and digitally signs the SOAP message before communicating
the request to the remote service endpoint. On the server side, a SOAP
message handler intercepts the SOAP message, performs verification and
decryption steps before dispatching the RPC request to the target
service endpoint implementation. The same steps are repeated in reverse
for the RPC response carried in a SOAP message.

[#50634753_pgfId-1082891]##Note that other types of handlers (for
example; stream based handlers, post-binding typed handlers) can be
developed for SOAP message processing specific to a JAX-RPC runtime
system and the corresponding container. However, the JAX-RPC
specification specifies APIs for only SOAP message handlers. Any
container specific processing of SOAP message is out of scope for this
version of the JAX-RPC specification.

[#50634753_pgfId-1095667]##The _MessageContext_ parameter provides
access to the message context (for example: a SOAP message that carries
an RPC request or response) that is processed by a handler. The

[#50634753_pgfId-1105872]##The _javax.xml.rpc.handler.GenericHandler_
class is an abstract class that implements the _Handler_ interface.

[#50634753_pgfId-1089062]##An implementation class for the

===== [#50634753_pgfId-1082590]##MessageContext

[#50634753_pgfId-1083375]##The interface _MessageContext_ abstracts the
message context that is processed by a handler in the _handleRequest_ ,
_handleResponse_ or _handleFault_ method.

[#50634753_pgfId-1086663]##}

[#50634753_pgfId-1086675]##The _MessageContext_ interface provides
methods to manage a property set. The _MessageContext_ properties enable
handlers in a handler chain to share processing related state. For
example, a handler may use the _setProperty_ method to set value for a
specific property in the message context. One or more other handlers in
the handler chain may use the _getProperty_ method to get the value of
the same property from the message context.

[#50634753_pgfId-1116644]##Please note that there is no specified
relationship between the message context properties and either the Stub
properties described in link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_21802[See Stub

share the same _MessageContext_ across _Handler_ instances that are
invoked during a single request and response or fault processing on a
specific service endpoint.

[#50634753_pgfId-1107748]## _Handler_ instances in a handler chain
should not rely on the thread local state to share state between handler

[#50634753_pgfId-1095909]##A JAX-RPC handler may be configured and used
on the service client as follows:

[#50634753_pgfId-1095910]##On the service client side, a request handler
is invoked before an RPC request is communicated to the target service
endpoint.

[#50634753_pgfId-1095911]##On the service client side, a response or

service client from the target service endpoint.

[#50634753_pgfId-1095912]##A JAX-RPC handler may configured and used on
a service endpoint as follows:

[#50634753_pgfId-1095913]##On the service endpoint side, a request

service endpoint.

[#50634753_pgfId-1095914]##On the service endpoint side, a response or

from the target service endpoint.

===== [#50634753_pgfId-1096333]##Processing Model

[#50634753_pgfId-1096339]##A SOAP message handler is required to process
a SOAP message and generate SOAP faults based on the processing model
specified in the SOAP link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_73033[See W3C Note: SOAP
1.1: http://www.w3.org/TR/SOAP/] specification.

======= [#50634753_pgfId-1101372]##HandlerChain

[#50634753_pgfId-1101672]##A _HandlerChain_ is configured to act in the
role of one or more SOAP actors, each actor specified using a _URI_
called SOAP _actor_ name. A _HandlerChain_ always acts in the role of a
special SOAP actor _next_ . Refer to the SOAP specification for the
_URI_ name for this special SOAP actor. The following methods in the
_HandlerChain_ interface support configuration of the SOAP actor roles:

[#50634753_pgfId-1101379]##package javax.xml.rpc.handler;

[#50634753_pgfId-1101380]##public interface HandlerChain extends
java.util.List \{

[#50634753_pgfId-1101382]## String[] getRoles();

[#50634753_pgfId-1101404]##}

[#50634753_pgfId-1101411]##A SOAP message _Handler_ instance is
associated with SOAP header blocks using the qualified name of the
outermost element of each header block. A _Handler_ indicates that it
would process specific header blocks through this association. The
following method initializes a _Handler_ instance for this association:

[#50634753_pgfId-1101428]##package javax.xml.rpc.handler;

[#50634753_pgfId-1101429]##public interface Handler \{

[#50634753_pgfId-1101460]## void init(HandlerInfo config);

[#50634753_pgfId-1102650]## // ...

[#50634753_pgfId-1107375]##}

[#50634753_pgfId-1107413]##A SOAP message _Handler_ instance gets access
to the SOAP Actor roles (set for the _HandlerChain_ instance for this
SOAP node) through the _SOAPMessageContext_ . _getRoles_ method. A
_Handler_ instance uses this information about the SOAP Actor roles to
process the SOAP header blocks. Note that the SOAP actor roles cannot be
changed during the processing of SOAP message through the _HandlerChain_
.

[#50634753_pgfId-1107724]##A _HandlerChain_ (on the SOAP receiver node)
performs the following steps during the SOAP message processing. Refer
to the SOAP specification link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_73033[See W3C Note:
SOAP 1.1: http://www.w3.org/TR/SOAP/] for the normative details on the
SOAP message processing model.:

[#50634753_pgfId-1101481]##Identify the set of SOAP actor roles in which
this _HandlerChain_ (at this SOAP node) is to act

[#50634753_pgfId-1101486]##Identify all header blocks targeted at this
node that are mandatory

[#50634753_pgfId-1101528]##If one or more of the header blocks
identified in the preceding step are not understood by this node then
generate a single SOAP _MustUnderstand_ fault. If such a fault is
generated, any further processing is not done. The _MustUnderstand_
fault is propagated to the client in both cases where _MustUnderstand_
fault is generated on either the server side or client side as part of
SOAP message processing.

[#50634753_pgfId-1101635]##Process all header blocks targeted at the
node by invoking its configured chain of handlers.

[#50634753_pgfId-1101621]##If processing is unsuccessful, exactly one
SOAP fault is generated by this _HandlerChain_ either by handlers or
JAX-RPC runtime system. This SOAP fault is propagated to the client
instead of the response SOAP message.

======= [#50634753_pgfId-1096272]##Handler

[#50634753_pgfId-1101671]##A _HandlerChain_ delegates processing of the
SOAP message to its configured chain of handlers.

[#50634753_pgfId-1107868]##The _handleRequest_ , _handleResponse_ and
_handleFault_ methods for a SOAP message handler get access to the
_SOAPMessage_ from the _SOAPMessageContext_ . The implementation of
these methods can modify the _SOAPMessage_ including the headers and
body elements.

[#50634753_pgfId-1096203]##The _handleRequest_ method performs one of
the following steps after performing handler specific processing of the
request SOAP message:

[#50634753_pgfId-1107616]##Return _true_ to indicate continued
processing of the request handler chain. The _HandlerChain_ takes the
responsibility of invoking the next entity. The next entity may be the
next handler in the _HandlerChain_ or if this handler is the last
handler in the chain, the next entity is the target service endpoint.
The mechanism for dispatch or invocation of the target service endpoint
depends on whether the request _HandlerChain_ is on the client side or
service endpoint side.

[#50634753_pgfId-1103875]##Return _false_ to indicate blocking of the
request handler chain. In this case, further processing of the request
handler chain is blocked and the target service endpoint is not
dispatched. The JAX-RPC runtime system takes the responsibility of
invoking the response handler chain next with the appropriate
_SOAPMessageContext_ . The _Handler_ implementation class has the
responsibility of setting the response SOAP message in the
_handleRequest_ method and perform additional processing in the
_handleResponse_ method. In the default processing model, the response
handler chain starts processing from the same _Handler_ instance (that
returned _false_ ) and goes backward in the execution sequence.

[#50634753_pgfId-1095924]##Throw the
_javax.xml.rpc.soap.SOAPFaultException_ to indicate a SOAP fault. The
_Handler_ implementation class has the responsibility of setting the
SOAP fault in the SOAP message in either _handleRequest_ and/or
_handleFault_ method. If _SOAPFaultException_ is thrown by a server-side
request handler’s _handleRequest_ method, the _HandlerChain_ terminates
the further processing of the request handlers in this handler chain and
invokes the _handleFault_ method on the _HandlerChain_ with the SOAP
message context. Next, the _HandlerChain_ invokes the _handleFault_
method on handlers registered in the handler chain, beginning with the
_Handler_ instance that threw the exception and going backward in
execution. The client-side request handler’s _handleRequest_ method
should not throw the _SOAPFault-Exception_ . Refer to the SOAP
specification for details on the various SOAP _faultcode_ values and
corresponding specification.

[#50634753_pgfId-1105947]##Throw the _JAXRPCException_ or any other
_RuntimeException_ for any handler specific runtime error. If
_JAXRPCException_ is thrown by a _handleRequest_ method, the
_HandlerChain_ terminates the further processing of this handler chain.
On the server side, the _HandlerChain_ generates a SOAP fault that
indicates that the message could not be processed for reasons not
directly attributable to the contents of the message itself but rather
to a runtime error during the processing of the message. Refer to the
SOAP specification for details on the various SOAP _faultcode_ values.
On the client side, the _JAXRPCException_ or runtime exception is
propagated to the client code as a _RemoteException_ or its subtype.

[#50634753_pgfId-1096274]##The _handleResponse_ method performs the
processing of the SOAP response message. It does one of the following
steps after performing its handler specific processing of the SOAP
message:

[#50634753_pgfId-1095928]##Return _true_ to indicate continued
processing of the response handler chain. The _HandlerChain_ invokes the
_handleResponse_ method on the next _Handler_ in the handler chain.

[#50634753_pgfId-1096234]##Return _false_ to indicate blocking of the
response handler chain. In this case, no other response handlers in the
handler chain are invoked. On the service endpoint side, this may be
useful if response handler chooses to issue a response directly without
requiring other response handlers to be invoked.

[#50634753_pgfId-1103886]##Throw the _JAXRPCException_ or any other
_RuntimeException_ for any handler specific runtime error. If
_JAXRPCException_ is thrown by the _handleResponse_ method, the
_HandlerChain_ terminates the further processing of this handler chain.
On the server side, the _HandlerChain_ generates a SOAP fault that
indicates that the message could not be processed for reasons not
directly attributable to the contents of the message itself but rather
to a runtime error during the processing of the message. On the client
side, the _JAXRPCException_ or runtime exception is propagated to the
client code as a _RemoteException_ or its subtype.

[#50634753_pgfId-1107804]##The _handleFault_ method performs the SOAP
fault related processing. The JAX-RPC runtime system should invoke the
_handleFault_ method if a SOAP fault needs to be processed by either
client-side or server-side handlers. The _handleFault_ method does one
of the following steps after performing handler specific processing of
the SOAP fault:

[#50634753_pgfId-1107829]##Return _true_ to indicate continued
processing of the fault handlers in the handler chain. The
_HandlerChain_ invokes the _handleFault_ method on the next _Handler_ in
the handler chain.

[#50634753_pgfId-1107830]##Return _false_ to indicate blocking of the
fault processing in the handler chain. In this case, no other handlers
in the handler chain are invoked. The JAX-RPC runtime system takes the
further responsibility of processing the SOAP message.

[#50634753_pgfId-1108127]##Throw _JAXRPCException_ or any other
_RuntimeException_ for any handler specific runtime error. If
_JAXRPCException_ is thrown by the _handleFault_ method, the
_HandlerChain_ terminates the further processing of this handler chain.
On the server side, the _HandlerChain_ generates a SOAP fault that
indicates that the message could not be processed for reasons not
directly attributable to the contents of the message itself but rather
to a runtime error during the processing of the message. On the client
side, the _JAXRPCException_ or runtime exception is propagated to the
client code as a _RemoteException_ or its subtype.

[#50634753_pgfId-1116654]##Please note that when a JAXRPCException or
RuntimeException raised on the server is converted to a SOAP fault for
the purpose of being transmitted to the client, there are no guarantees
that any of the information it contains will be preserved.

======= [#50634753_pgfId-1095932]##Example

[#50634753_pgfId-1106881]##The following shows an example of the SOAP
fault processing. In this case, the request handler _H2_ on the server

===== [#50634753_pgfId-1084268]##Handler Configuration APIs

[#50634753_pgfId-1084274]##A developer performs the programmatic
configuration of handlers using the
_javax.xml.rpc.handler.HandlerRegistry_ interface.

[#50634753_pgfId-1099253]##The _Service_ interface provides access to

Handler Lifecycle

[#50634753_pgfId-1084029]##A SOAP message handler is required to be
implemented as a stateless instance. A SOAP message handler must not
maintain any SOAP message related state in its instance variables across
multiple invocations of the _handle_ method. In terms of the SOAP
message processing functionality, the JAX-RPC runtime system considers
all instances of a specific handler class as equivalent. The JAX-RPC
runtime system may choose any ready instance of a _Handler_ class to
invoke the handle methods. This makes the _Handler_ instances as capable
of pooling by the JAX-RPC runtime system per deployed endpoint
component. However, JAX-RPC runtime system is not required to support
pooling of _Handler_ instances.

[#50634753_pgfId-1083791]##A SOAP message handler is required to
implement the following lifecycle methods of the
_javax.xml.rpc.handler.Handler_ interface:

[#50634753_pgfId-1083813]##package javax.xml.rpc.handler;

[#50634753_pgfId-1083814]##public interface Handler \{

[#50634753_pgfId-1083815]## void init(HandlerInfo config);

[#50634753_pgfId-1083818]## void destroy();

[#50634753_pgfId-1083831]## // ...

[#50634753_pgfId-1103897]##}

[#50634753_pgfId-1083833]##The JAX-RPC runtime system is required to
manage the lifecycle of _Handler_ instances by invoking the _init_ and
_destroy_ methods.

[#50634753_pgfId-1085792]##The following state transition diagram shows
the lifecycle of a _Handler_ instance:

[#50634753_pgfId-1085813]## 

image:jaxrpc-20.gif[image]

[#50634753_pgfId-1085812]##The JAX-RPC runtime system is responsible for
loading the _Handler_ class and instantiating the corresponding
_Handler_ object. The lifecycle of a _Handler_ instance begins when the
JAX-RPC runtime system creates a new instance of the _Handler_ class.

[#50634753_pgfId-1096316]##After a _Handler_ is instantiated, the
JAX-RPC runtime system is required to initialize the _Handler_ before
this _Handler_ instance can start processing the SOAP messages. The
JAX-RPC runtime system invokes the _init_ method to enable the _Handler_
instance to initialize itself. The _init_ method passes the handler
configuration as a _HandlerInfo_ instance. The _HandlerInfo_ is used to
configure the _Handler_ (for example: setup access to an external
resource or service) during the initialization. The _init_ method also
associates a _Handler_ instance (using the _HandlerInfo_ ) with zero or
more header blocks using the corresponding _QNames_ .

[#50634753_pgfId-1085836]##In the _init_ method, the _Handler_ class may
get access to any resources (for example; access to an authentication
service, logging service) and maintain these as part of its instance
variables. Note that these instance variables must not have any state
specific to the SOAP message processing performed in the various
_handle_ method.

[#50634753_pgfId-1103184]##Once the _Handler_ instance is created and
initialized (and is in the _Ready_ state), the JAX-RPC runtime system
may invoke the different _handle_ method multiple times.

[#50634753_pgfId-1103190]##The JAX-RPC runtime system is required to
invoke the _destroy_ method when the runtime system determines that the
_Handler_ object is no longer needed. For example, the JAX-RPC runtime
may remove a _Handler_ object when the runtime system (in an managed
operational environment) is shutting down or managing memory resources.

[#50634753_pgfId-1103188]##The _destroy_ method indicates the end of
lifecycle for a _Handler_ instance. The _Handler_ instance releases its
resources and performs cleanup in the implementation of the _destroy_
method. After successful invocation of the _destroy_ method, the
_Handler_ object is available for the garbage collection.

[#50634753_pgfId-1105933]##A _RuntimeException_ (other than
_SOAPFaultException_ ) thrown from any method of the _Handler_ results
in the _destroy_ method being invoked and transition to the “ _Does Not
Exist_ ” state.

[#50634753_pgfId-1036600]##The JAX-RPC specification requires support
for HTTP Basic Authentication for protocol bindings over the HTTP
transport.

[#50634753_pgfId-1036628]##The HTTP Basic Authentication uses user name
and password for authenticating a service client. The
_javax.xml.rpc.Stub_ and _javax.xml.rpc.Call_ interfaces are required to
support _“javax.xml.rpc.security.auth.username”_ and
_“javax.xml.rpc.security.auth.password”_ properties for the HTTP Basic
Authentication. For convenience, the properties above can be referenced
using resp. the _USERNAME_PROPERTY_ and _PASSWORD_PROPERTY_ constants
defined by the _Stub_ and _Call_ interfaces.

[#50634753_pgfId-1101340]##During invocation of a remote method, HTTP
server (considered part of a JAX-RPC server side runtime system) uses
user name and password to authenticate the service client. The
authentication is performed in a specific security realm.

======= [#50634753_pgfId-1036668]##Example

[#50634753_pgfId-1036672]##The following shows an illustrative example
of a service client accessing a service endpoint bound to SOAP over
HTTP. The user name and password passed in the _getStockQuoteProvider_
method are used for authenticating the service client using the HTTP
Basic Authentication:

[#50634753_pgfId-1036684]## StockQuoteService sqs = // ... Get access to
the service

[#50634753_pgfId-1036685]## StockQuoteProvider sqp =
sqs.getStockQuoteProviderPort(

[#50634753_pgfId-1036690]## "<username>", "<password>");

[#50634753_pgfId-1036686]## float quote = sqp.getLastTradePrice("ACME");

[#50634753_pgfId-1036682]##The following shows the same example using
the properties mechanism for the configuration of a stub instance:

[#50634753_pgfId-1036712]## StockQuoteProvider_Stub sqp = // ... get to
the stub;

[#50634753_pgfId-1036728]## sqp._setProperty(Stub.USERNAME_PROPERTY,
"<username>");

[#50634753_pgfId-1092110]## sqp._setProperty(Stub.PASSWORD_PROPERTY,
"<password>");

[#50634753_pgfId-1036793]## float quote = sqp.getLastTradePrice("ACME");

===== [#50634753_pgfId-1036565]##SSL Mutual Authentication

[#50634753_pgfId-1036665]##The JAX-RPC specification does not require
support for the certificate based mutual authentication using HTTP/S
(HTTP over SSL) mechanism.

===== [#50634753_pgfId-1040671]##SOAP Security Extensions

[#50634753_pgfId-1071403]##The JAX-RPC specification does not require
support for the SOAP Security Extensions for digital signature

[#50634753_47517]##Session Management

[#50634753_pgfId-1038224]##The JAX-RPC specification requires that a
service client be able to participate in a session with a service
endpoint.

[#50634753_pgfId-1106738]##In the JAX-RPC 1.1 version, the session
management mechanisms require use of HTTP as the transport in the
protocol binding. This version of the JAX-RPC specification does not
specify (or require) session management using SOAP headers given that
there is no standard SOAP header representation for the session
information. SOAP based session management may be considered in the
future versions of the JAX-RPC specification.

[#50634753_pgfId-1106751]##A JAX-RPC runtime system is required to use
at least one of the following mechanisms to manage sessions:

[#50634753_pgfId-1038294]##Cookie based mechanism: On the initial method
invocation on a service endpoint, the server side JAX-RPC runtime system
sends a cookie to the service client to initiate a new session. If
service client wants to participate in this session, the client side
JAX-RPC runtime system then sends the cookie for each subsequent method
invocation on this service endpoint. The cookie associates subsequent
method invocations from the service client with the same session.

[#50634753_pgfId-1038338]##URL rewriting involves adding session related
identifier to a URL. This rewritten URL is used by the server-side
JAX-RPC runtime to associate RPC invocations to the service endpoint
with a session. The URL that is rewritten depends on the protocol
binding in use.

[#50634753_pgfId-1042017]##SSL session may be used to associate multiple
RPC invocations on a service endpoint as part of a single session.

[#50634753_pgfId-1106858]##A session (in JAX-RPC) is initiated by the
server-side JAX-RPC runtime system. The server-side JAX-RPC runtime
system may use _HTTPSession_ (defined in the Servlet specification
link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_71367[See J2EE Specifications:
http://java.sun.com/j2ee/]) to implement support for the HTTP session
management.

[#50634753_pgfId-1106717]##A service client uses the
_javax.xml.rpc.session.maintain_ property (set using the _Stub_ or
_Call_ interfaces) to indicate whether or not it wants to participate in
a session with a service endpoint. By default, this property is _false_
, so the client does not participate in a session by default. However,
by setting _session.maintain_ property to _true_ , the client indicates
that it wants to join the session initiated by the server. In the cookie
case, the client runtime system accepts the cookie and returns the
session tracking information to the server, thereby joining the session.

[#50634753_pgfId-1106784]##The client code by setting the
_session.maintain_ property assumes that it would participate in a
session if one is initiated by the server. The actual session management
happens transparent to the client code in the client-side runtime
system.

[#50634753_pgfId-1106840]##Note that JAX-RPC specification does not
require session management as part of the interoperability requirements
(specified in the link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_28459[See Interoperability]).

has a standard J2EE compatible application server that supports a
JAX-RPC runtime system implementation. The vendor C has a vendor
specific product that supports XML based RPC using SOAP 1.1 and WSDL
1.1.

Interoperability Requirements

[#50634753_pgfId-1112272]##The following section specifies
interoperability requirements for the scenarios identified as within the
scope of the JAX-RPC 1.0 specification.

[#50634753_pgfId-1112277]##Please note that the JAX-RPC 1.1
specification added several interoperability requirements based on the
work done in the Web Service Interoperability Organization. These
requirements are detailed in link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_50738[See
Interoperability Requirements: WS-I Basic Profile Version 1.0].

===== [#50634753_pgfId-1110822]##SOAP based Interoperability

[#50634753_pgfId-1039806]##An interoperable JAX-RPC implementation must
be able to support SOAP 1.1 with attachments
link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_28069[See W3 Note: SOAP Messages with
Attachments: http://www.w3.org/TR/SOAP-attachments] as the underlying
protocol. A vendor’s implementation of the SOAP 1.1 protocol must be
based on the standard SOAP specification
link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_73033[See W3C Note: SOAP 1.1:
http://www.w3.org/TR/SOAP/]. A SOAP based JAX-RPC runtime system
implementation must interoperate with other JAX-RPC implementations and
vendor specific products that support SOAP 1.1 with attachments.

[#50634753_pgfId-1039833]##The JAX-RPC specification does not specify
interoperability requirements for any protocol other than the SOAP 1.1
with attachments. However, the JAX-RPC specification allows a JAX-RPC
runtime system implementation to support protocol bindings other than
SOAP. Note that any non-SOAP based JAX-RPC implementation is not
interoperable by definition based on the JAX-RPC interoperability
requirements.

===== [#50634753_pgfId-1039888]##SOAP Encoding and XML Schema Support

[#50634753_pgfId-1040629]##The JAX-RPC specification requires support
for the following representation for remote call and response in a SOAP
message:

[#50634753_pgfId-1039895]##Encoded representation using the SOAP 1.1
encoding: The rules and format of serialization for the XML data types
are based on the SOAP 1.1 encoding link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_73033[See
W3C Note: SOAP 1.1: http://www.w3.org/TR/SOAP/]. A JAX-RPC runtime
system implementation is required to support the SOAP 1.1 encoding.
Interoperability requirements for any other encodings are outside the
scope of the JAX-RPC specification.

[#50634753_pgfId-1074675]##Refer to the
link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_87798[See Supported Type Systems] for the XML
Schema data types and Java types that an interoperable JAX-RPC runtime
system implementation is required to support.

[#50634753_pgfId-1077010]##The sections
link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_19087[See XML to Java Type Mapping] and
link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_44250[See Java to XML Type Mapping] specify the
standard mapping between the XML data types and Java types. A JAX-RPC
implementation is required to support the standard type mapping between
XML data and Java types.

===== [#50634753_pgfId-1039918]##Transport

[#50634753_pgfId-1039861]##A JAX-RPC runtime system implementation must
be able to support HTTP 1.1 as the underlying transport. The required
SOAP binding to HTTP 1.1 is specified in the SOAP specification

http://www.w3.org/TR/SOAP/].

[#50634753_pgfId-1060865]##The interoperability requirements for any
other transport are outside the scope of the JAX-RPC specification. Note
that a future version of the JAX-RPC specification may consider
specifying interoperability requirements for additional transports. This
support depends on the standardization (in the SOAP W3C working group)
of the SOAP binding framework for different transports.

===== [#50634753_pgfId-1060876]##WSDL Requirements

[#50634753_pgfId-1060968]##For each deployed JAX-RPC service endpoint, a
JAX-RPC implementation must be able to export an equivalent WSDL 1.1
based service description. The mapping to a WSDL based service
description should follow the standard Java to WSDL mapping specified in
the link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_40474[See Java to WSDL Mapping].

[#50634753_pgfId-1065609]##An exported WSDL based service description
must not include any vendor specific extensibility elements. Note that
the use of such vendor specific extensibility elements may constrain
interoperability.

[#50634753_pgfId-1060931]##An interoperable JAX-RPC implementation must
be capable of importing a WSDL 1.1 based service description. The
mapping of an imported WSDL service description to the equivalent Java
representation is required to follow the standard WSDL to Java mapping
as specified in the link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_51248[See WSDL to Java
Mapping]. Note that the use of a specific service client programming
model (whether generated stub or dynamic proxy based) must not impact
the interoperability.

===== [#50634753_pgfId-1040075]##Processing of SOAP Headers

[#50634753_pgfId-1067929]##An interoperable JAX-RPC implementation must
be able to support the standard processing model for SOAP headers as
specified in the SOAP specification link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_65269[See

http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/CR-soap12-part2-20021219/]. Note that the SOAP
specification does not define any standard representation for the SOAP
headers.

[#50634753_pgfId-1065616]##An explicit goal of the JAX-RPC specification
is not to define any SOAP header representation for transaction,
security or session related information. A goal of the JAX-RPC
specification is to leverage work done in other standardization groups
for this aspect. An important point to note is that any JAX-RPC specific
definition of SOAP headers or session related information is against the
design goal of achieving SOAP based interoperability with heterogeneous
environments.

[#50634753_pgfId-1040160]##A remote method in a service endpoint
interface is required to throw the standard _java.rmi.RemoteException_ .
A _RemoteException_ or its subclass maps to a fault in the corresponding

[#50634753_41163]##Extensible Type Mapping

image:jaxrpc-4.gif[image]

[#50634753_pgfId-1065343]##This chapter specifies APIs for supporting an
extensible type mapping framework in a JAX-RPC implementation.

[#50634753_pgfId-1006314]##The JAX-RPC specification specifies a
standard mapping between XML data types and Java types. The standard
type mapping supports a set of XML data types defined in the SOAP 1.1
encoding and XML Schema specification. Refer to the
link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_83219[See Appendix: XML Schema Support] for the
supported set of XML data types. The standard type mapping also
specifies the XML mapping for the set of Java types supported by the
JAX-RPC. Refer to the link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_19087[See XML to Java
Type Mapping] and link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_44250[See Java to XML Type
Mapping] for more details on the standard type mapping.

[#50634753_pgfId-1054101]##A JAX-RPC implementation may need to support
mapping between XML data types and Java types beyond that addressed by
the standard type mapping specification.

[#50634753_pgfId-1061116]##The JAX-RPC specification specifies APIs to
support an extensible type mapping framework. These APIs enable
development of pluggable serializers and deserializers to support an
extensible mapping between any Java type and XML data type. The
pluggable serializers and deserializers may be packaged as part of a
JAX-RPC implementation or may be provided by tools vendors, service
developers and service clients.

Design Goals

[#50634753_pgfId-1013316]##The JAX-RPC specification identifies the
following design goals for the extensible type mapping framework:

[#50634753_pgfId-1013376]##The type mapping framework should enable the
development of pluggable serializers and deserializers using different
XML processing mechanisms and representations. Note that the performance
of a pluggable serializer or deserializer depends on the choice of an
XML processing mechanism and representation. For example, a DOM based
deserializer is typically less performance efficient than a SAX or
streaming parser based deserializer.

[#50634753_pgfId-1013343]##The type mapping framework should not enforce
a specific XML processing mechanism or representation on a JAX-RPC
implementation. A JAX-RPC implementation should be allowed to use a
performance efficient XML processing mechanism.

[#50634753_pgfId-1013628]##The application programming model for
development and pluggability (into the type mapping framework) of
serializers and deserializers should be simple. The type mapping
framework should enable a JAX-RPC implementation vendor, application
developer and tools vendor to develop pluggable serializers and
deserializers.

[#50634753_pgfId-1065409]##Note that the portability of pluggable
serializers and deserializers across various JAX-RPC implementations is
not addressed in the JAX-RPC 1.1 version. The reasons are as follows:

[#50634753_pgfId-1065410]##Existing SOAP implementations typically use
either SAX based or streaming pull parser for the XML processing. The
primary motivation is better performance. It will be difficult (in terms
of the time to market for various JAX-RPC implementations) to enforce
any standard portable API for XML processing and representation on all
JAX-RPC implementations.

[#50634753_pgfId-1065411]##Portability of XML processing mechanism
specific serializers and deserializers to a JAX-RPC implementation that
uses a different XML processing mechanism is non-trivial to implement.
For example, a DOM based serializer may not be easily pluggable on a
JAX-RPC implementation that uses a streaming pull parser.

[#50634753_pgfId-1054134]##Support for portable serializers and
deserializers will be addressed in the next version of the JAX-RPC
specification.

Type Mapping Framework

[#50634753_pgfId-1061155]##The _javax.xml.rpc.encoding_ package defines
a set of Java interfaces/classes for the type mapping framework. The
following diagram shows the JAX-RPC type mapping framework.

[#50634753_pgfId-1013420]## 

image:jaxrpc-22.gif[image]

[#50634753_pgfId-1023086]##The _Serializer_ and _Deserializer_
interfaces enable development of pluggable serializers and deserializers
that support extensible mapping between XML data types and Java types.

[#50634753_pgfId-1013489]##A _Serializer_ serializes a Java object to an
XML representation based on the type mapping defined between the
corresponding Java type and the XML data type. Examples are serializers
defined for Java arrays and classes in the standard Java Collection
framework. A serializer typically uses the XML schema definition for an
XML schema instance to generate the corresponding XML representation.

[#50634753_pgfId-1013421]##A _Deserializer_ deserializes an XML element
or schema instance to a Java object. The deserialization is based on the
type mapping defined between an XML data type and the corresponding Java
type. A deserializer typically uses the XML schema fragment and the
corresponding XML schema instance to map to the corresponding Java
object.

[#50634753_pgfId-1013519]##The _Serializer_ and _Deserializer_ are the
base interfaces defined to be independent of any XML processing
mechanism and XML representation. A JAX-RPC implementation must extend
these two interfaces to support development of serializers and
deserializers based on a specific XML processing mechanism. Examples of
various XML processing mechanisms that may be supported by
implementation specific serializers and deserializers are:

[#50634753_pgfId-1013679]##DOM based XML processing

[#50634753_pgfId-1013683]##SAX based XML processing

[#50634753_pgfId-1013684]##Streaming pull parser

[#50634753_pgfId-1013685]##Object based input and output streams

[#50634753_pgfId-1013623]##A JAX-RPC runtime system is also required to
implement both _SerializationContext_ and _DeserializationContext_
interfaces. These two interfaces provide XML processing and JAX-RPC
runtime system related context to the serializers and deserializers
during serialization and deserialization.

[#50634753_pgfId-1068283]##Note that the type mapping framework does not
require an implementation of a JAX-RPC runtime system to use a specific
XML processing mechanism. For example, a JAX-RPC implementation may use
a streaming pull parser for performance efficient XML processing. DOM or
SAX based deserializers may still be developed and plugged into the
extensible type mapping framework provided by this JAX-RPC
implementation. To support such DOM or SAX based deserializers, this
JAX-RPC implementation may include adapters from the underlying XML
processing mechanism (streaming pull parser in this case) to both SAX
and DOM representations.

[#50634753_pgfId-1013658]##JAX-RPC specification does not require that a
JAX-RPC implementation support pluggablility of serializers and
deserializers of multiple XML processing mechanism types. A JAX-RPC
implementation may choose to support any number but must support at
least one of the XML processing mechanism types for serializers and
deserializers.

API Specification

[#50634753_pgfId-1089976]##This section specifies the JAX-RPC APIs for

[#50634753_pgfId-1090013]##The interface
_javax.xml.rpc.encoding.TypeMappingRegistry_ defines a registry for the
type mappings for various encoding styles.

[#50634753_pgfId-1090014]##The following code snippet shows the
_TypeMappingRegistry_ interface:

[#50634753_pgfId-1090015]##package javax.xml.rpc.encoding;

[#50634753_pgfId-1097488]##A _TypeMapping_ instance is associated with
[1-n] _encodingStyleURIs_ . An _encodingStyleURI_ is associated with
[0-1] _TypeMapping_ instance.

[#50634753_pgfId-1105030]##The method _register(_ String, TypeMapping)
registers a _TypeMapping_ instance with the _TypeMappingRegistry_ . This
method replaces any existing registered _TypeMapping_ instance for the
specified _encodingStyleURI_ . The parameter _encodingStyleURI_ must be
a namespace URI that represent a single encoding style. An example is
the SOAP 1.1 encoding represented by the namespace URI
_http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/_ . The _""_ (zero-length URI)
is used to indicate that there are no claims about the encoding style.

[#50634753_pgfId-1097476]##The method _unregisterTypeMapping_
unregisters a _TypeMapping_ instance from the specified
_encodingStyleURI_ .

[#50634753_pgfId-1097470]##The method _registerDefault_ ( _TypeMapping_
) registers the default _TypeMapping_ for all encoding styles supported
by the _TypeMappingRegistry_ . Successive invocations of the
_registerDefault_ method replace any existing registered default
_TypeMapping_ instance. A default _TypeMapping_ should include
serializers and deserializers that are independent of and usable with
any encoding styles.

[#50634753_pgfId-1090032]##The JAX-RPC specification does not require
that a default _TypeMapping_ be registered in the _TypeMappingRegistry_
. If the default _TypeMapping_ is registered, any other _TypeMapping_
instances registered through the _TypeMappingRegistry_ . _register_
method (for a set of _encodingStyle_ URIs) is required to override the
default _TypeMapping_ .

[#50634753_pgfId-1090033]##The method getRegisteredEncodingStyleURIs
returns a list of registered _encodingStyle_ URIs in this
_TypeMappingRegistry_ instance.

[#50634753_pgfId-1090034]##The method _getTypeMapping_ returns the
registered _TypeMapping_ for the specified _encodingStyleURI_ . If there
is no registered _TypeMapping_ for the specified _encodingStyleURI_ ,
this method returns _null_ .

[#50634753_pgfId-1090035]##The method _clear_ removes all registered
_TypeMapping_ instances from this _TypeMappingRegistry_ .

[#50634753_pgfId-1090036]##The method _createTypeMapping_ creates an
empty _TypeMapping_ object. Refer to the _TypeMapping_ interface for
more details.

[#50634753_pgfId-1090038]##In the service client programming model, the
_javax.xml.rpc.Service_ interface supports the configuration of a

[#50634753_pgfId-1097905]##}

[#50634753_pgfId-1090044]##The method _getTypeMappingRegistry_ returns
the _TypeMappingRegistry_ for this service object. The returned
_TypeMappingRegistry_ instance is required to be pre- configured for
supporting the standard type mapping between XML and Java types as
specified in the sections link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_19087[See XML to Java
Type Mapping] and link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_44250[See Java to XML Type
Mapping]. This getter method is required to throw the
_java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException_ if the _Service_ class does
not support configuration of a _TypeMappingRegistry_ .

[#50634753_pgfId-1090046]##Dynamic proxies, _Call_ objects or instances
of generated stub classes created from the service class use the
configured _TypeMappingRegistry_ to access the extensible type mapping
framework. For example, a dynamic proxy uses the configured
_TypeMappingRegistry_ to perform serialization and deserialization of
the Java and XML data types.

[#50634753_pgfId-1090047]##Note that a generated stub class may embed
the type mapping support in the generated code. In this case, a
generated stub class is not required to use the configured type mapping
registry.

[#50634753_pgfId-1090049]##The _javax.xml.rpc.encoding.TypeMapping_ is
the base interface for the representation of type mappings. A
_TypeMapping_ supports a set of encoding styles. The method
_getSupportedEncodings_ returns the _encodingStyle_ URIs (as _String[]_
) supported by a _TypeMapping_ instance. The method
_setSupportedEncodings_ sets the supported _encodingStyle_ URIs for a

[#50634753_pgfId-1090071]##The JAX-RPC specification allows serializers
and deserializers to be developed independent of any specific encoding
style. Such serializers and deserializers are usable across multiple
encoding styles. A _TypeMapping_ that contains only such serializers and
deserializers is required to pass _null_ to the _setSupportedEncodings_
method and return _null_ from the getSupportedEncodings method.

[#50634753_pgfId-1090072]##For its supported encoding styles, a
_TypeMapping_ instance maintains a set of tuples of the type \{Java
type, _SerializerFactory_ , _DeserializerFactory_ , XML data type}.

[#50634753_pgfId-1090073]##The _getSerializer_ and _getDeserializer_
methods take both _javaType_ and _xmlType_ parameters. This enables
serializers and deserializers to support a flexible mapping between the

specific XML data type to different Java types based on the application
specific configuration.

[#50634753_pgfId-1023610]##The following code snippet shows the
_Deserializer_ interface:

[#50634753_pgfId-1014935]##javax.xml.rpc.encoding;

[#50634753_pgfId-1023673]##public interface Deserializer extends
java.io.Serializable \{

[#50634753_pgfId-1014936]## String getMechanismType();

[#50634753_pgfId-1014919]##}

[#50634753_pgfId-1074885]##An XML processing mechanism specific
deserializer extends the base _Deserializer_ interface. The method
_getMechanismType_ returns the type of the XML processing mechanism
supported by this deserializer. Such mechanism specific deserializer may
be either DOM based, SAX based, streaming parser based or stream based.

[#50634753_pgfId-1074886]##The
_javax.xml.rpc.encoding.DeserializationContext_ interface is implemented
by the JAX-RPC runtime system in an XML processing mechanism specific
manner. A deserializer uses this interface to access and maintain
context information during the deserialization. The following code
snippet shows the _DeserializationContext_ interface:

[#50634753_pgfId-1023772]##package javax.xml.rpc.encoding;

[#50634753_pgfId-1023773]##public interface DeserializationContext \{

[#50634753_pgfId-1065519]##}

[#50634753_pgfId-1067263]##Refer to the
link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_44066[See Appendix: Serialization Framework]
for an illustrative implementation of the serialization framework. This
API design is based on the JAX-RPC reference implementation.

[#50634753_99909]##Futures

image:jaxrpc-4.gif[image]

[#50634753_pgfId-1104919]##The following features would be considered in
the future versions of the JAX-RPC specification. The technical details
of these features would be resolved in the expert group of the
corresponding JSR. The following is a brief overview of these features:

{empty}[#50634753_pgfId-1104980]##Support for SOAP 1.2
link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_65269[See W3C: SOAP 1.2:
http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/CR-soap12-part1-20021219/ and
http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/CR-soap12-part2-20021219/]

[#50634753_pgfId-1104925]##Extended support for customization and
toolability aspects of JAX-RPC value types. This would enable tools to
customize serialization semantics and representation of the JAX-RPC
value types.

[#50634753_pgfId-1104966]##Extended support for XML schema types and
Java types

[#50634753_pgfId-1107934]##Design of portable serializers and
deserializers. This will enable custom serializers to be portable across
JAX-RPC implementations.

[#50634753_pgfId-1107353]##Enhanced support for security. For example,
mutual authentication using HTTP/S

[#50634753_pgfId-1104976]##Design of portable stubs.

[#50634753_pgfId-1107937]##Support for WSDL 1.2. This depends on the
schedule of the W3C Web Services Description Working Group
link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_54533[See W3C Web Services Description Working
Group: http://www.w3.org/2002/ws/desc].

[#50634753_pgfId-1107942]##Alignment with the JAXB
link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_99925[See JAXB specification:
http://java.sun.com/xml/jaxb/] specification.

[#50634753_pgfId-1068359]##Note that the XML data types listed in this
section are not exhaustive. Refer to the XML Schema specification for
the normative specification and examples of the XML Schema language. Any
XML data types not listed in this section are not required to be
supported by a JAX-RPC implementation.

[#50634753_pgfId-1068360]##The following definitions are used to
indicate the JAX-RPC support:

[#50634753_pgfId-1068361]##Required: A JAX-RPC implementation is
required to support the Java mapping of an XML data type by using one or
more of the following options:

{empty}[#50634753_pgfId-1068364]##The standard Java mapping of the XML
data types as specified in the link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_19087[See XML to

[#50634753_pgfId-1059216]##Optional: A JAX-RPC implementation is not
required to support the Java mapping of a specific XML data type. A
service using this XML data types may not be supported and interoperate
with a JAX-RPC implementation.

[#50634753_pgfId-1110394]##WSDL to Java mapping tools must be able to
process WSDL documents that use any of the features listed below,
including those marked as optional. Tools should map XML types that use
any of the optional features to javax.xml.soap.SOAPElement when used in
literal parts (see link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_61828[See Java Mapping of
Literal Representation]). Additionally, tools must be able to process
schemas that use the _xsd:include_ and _xsd:import_ constructs.

[#50634753_pgfId-1110412]##The following XML Schema features are not
required to be supported and WSDL to Java mapping tools are allowed to
reject documents that use them: _xsd:redefine_ , _xsd:notation_ ,
substitution groups.

Appendix: [#50634753_44066]##Serialization Framework

image:jaxrpc-4.gif[image]

[#50634753_pgfId-1065753]##This chapter describes the serialization
framework that is part of the JAX-RPC Reference Implementation (JAX-RPC
RI). Note that this design is non-prescriptive and serves as an
illustration of how the base type mapping framework can be extended in
an implementation specific manner.

[#50634753_pgfId-1068075]##The serialization framework includes the
interfaces, classes, and algorithms used by the JAX-RPC RI to serialize
and deserialize SOAP messages using SOAP 1.1 Section 5 encoding. It is
used to serialize and deserialize all Java types that are subtypes of
_java.lang.Object_ , including JavaBeans, structures, arrays, boxed
primitives, and any other kind of object. Primitive Java types (i.e.,
int, float, etc.) are handled by a similar but much simpler
serialization framework that is only briefly described here.

[#50634753_pgfId-1065754]##The SOAP 1.1 encoding allows arbitrary graphs
of Java objects to be serialized as XML. The most interesting case is
when an object graph contains multiple references to the same object. In
this case, the _HREF_ mechanism of the SOAP encoding may be used to
preserve object identity, thus making it possible to restore an object
graph exactly as it was before serialization. By far, the main
complicating factor in serializing and deserializing object graphs using
SOAP encoding is ensuring that _HREFs_ are handled correctly. As will
become clear, most of the JAX-RPC RI serialization framework is
motivated by the need to correctly process _HREFs_ .

[#50634753_pgfId-1065755]##This chapter is divided into two main
sections:

[#50634753_pgfId-1066323]##Serialization section describes how the
framework serializes a graph of Java objects as XML using SOAP encoding.

[#50634753_pgfId-1066327]##Deserialization section describes how the
framework deserializes SOAP-encoded object graphs into corresponding
Java object graphs.

Serialization

[#50634753_pgfId-1065757]##A serializer is a class that knows how to
encode instances of a particular Java type as XML using SOAP encoding.
When a client of the serialization framework (e.g., a stub) needs to
serialize a Java object, it obtains a reference to a serializer for the
object’s type and invokes the _serialize_ method on it, passing as
parameters the object to be serialized, an _XMLWriter_ , and a
_SOAPSerializationContext_ . The _serialize_ method creates the XML
representation of the Java object by using the passed-in _XMLWriter_ ,
which provides methods for writing XML elements to a stream.

[#50634753_pgfId-1066330]##Serializing a particular object consists of
opening a new XML element that represents the object, and then creating
sub-elements for each of the object’s members. Each member is serialized
by invoking the _serialize_ method on an appropriate serializer, passing
in the same _XMLWriter_ and _SOAPSerializationContext_ that was used to
serialize the parent object. After serializing each of its members, the
_serialize_ method closes the XML element for the object and returns.

[#50634753_pgfId-1065758]##For example, suppose that we want to
serialize an instance of a Java class named _Address_ . The code to do
this would be:

[#50634753_pgfId-1065759]## Address address = new Address("1234
Riverside Drive",

[#50634753_pgfId-1066336]## "Gainesville",

[#50634753_pgfId-1065760]## "Georgia", "30506");

[#50634753_pgfId-1065761]## XMLWriter writer = new XMLWriter(...);

[#50634753_pgfId-1065762]## SOAPSerializationContext serContext =

[#50634753_pgfId-1066331]## new SOAPSerializationContext(...);

[#50634753_pgfId-1065763]## AddressSerializer addressSer = new
AddressSerializer(...);

[#50634753_pgfId-1065764]## addressSer.serialize(address, new
QName(null, "home-address"),

[#50634753_pgfId-1065765]## writer, serContext);

[#50634753_pgfId-1065766]## serContext.serializeTrailingBlocks(writer);

[#50634753_pgfId-1065768]##The XML emitted by this code might look like
this:

[#50634753_pgfId-1065770]##<home-address href="#ID-1"/>

[#50634753_pgfId-1065771]##<tns:Address xsi:type="tns:Address"
id="ID-1">

[#50634753_pgfId-1065772]## <street href="#ID-2"/>

[#50634753_pgfId-1065774]## <state href="#ID-4"/>

[#50634753_pgfId-1065775]## <zip href="#ID-5"/>

[#50634753_pgfId-1065776]##</tns:Address>

===== [#50634753_pgfId-1065781]##Serializers

[#50634753_pgfId-1065782]##A serializer is a Java class with the
following characteristics:

[#50634753_pgfId-1066367]##A serializer must implement the
_SOAPSerializer_ interface

[#50634753_pgfId-1065784]##A serializer must be stateless. This allows
the JAX-RPC runtime to create and reuse a single serializer instance for
each XML Schema data type in the system, thus minimizing the number of
serializer objects that are created. Alternatively, a serializer may
store immutable state that is initialized when the serializer instance
is constructed.

[#50634753_pgfId-1065785]##A serializer must be multi-thread safe, thus
allowing the JAX-RPC runtime to use a single serializer instance across
multiple threads simultaneously.

===== [#50634753_pgfId-1065786]##SOAPSerializationContext

[#50634753_pgfId-1065787]##The _SOAPSerializationContext_ class contains
information that must be shared among and passed between the serializers
that participate in the serialization of a graph of Java objects. As an
object graph is being serialized, the same _SOAPSerializationContext_
instance is passed to each serializer that participates. Each method in
the _SOAPSerializer_ interface accepts a parameter of type
_SOAPSerializationContext_ which is used to propagate the context
between the various serializers.

[#50634753_pgfId-1065788]##The primary (and currently only) purpose of
the _SOAPSerializationContext_ is to ensure correct processing of
_HREFs_ . A _SOAPSerializationContext_ contains a map from object
references to _SOAPSerializationState_ objects. The first time a new
object is encountered in the serialization process, a
_SOAPSerializationState_ object is created for that object and added to
the map. The _SOAPSerializationState_ for an object stores a unique ID
assigned to that object and a reference to the serializer for that
object. The class _SOAPSerializationState_ is defined as follows:

[#50634753_pgfId-1065790]##package com.sun.xml.rpc.encoding.soap;

[#50634753_pgfId-1066390]##public class SOAPSerializationState \{

[#50634753_pgfId-1065791]## // ...

[#50634753_pgfId-1065793]## public SOAPSerializationState(Object obj,
String id,

[#50634753_pgfId-1065794]## SOAPSerializer serializer) \{...}

[#50634753_pgfId-1065796]## public Object getObject() \{...}

[#50634753_pgfId-1065798]## public String getID() \{...}

[#50634753_pgfId-1065800]## public SOAPSerializer getSerializer() \{...}

[#50634753_pgfId-1065801]##}

[#50634753_pgfId-1065803]##Associating a unique ID with each object
allows the serialization framework to preserve object identity in the
SOAP encoded object graph by always using the same ID for an object as
it encodes href and id attributes. Associating a serializer with each
object allows the serialization framework to know which serializers to
call as it serializes the independent elements that represent
multiple-reference objects (i.e., the trailing blocks).

[#50634753_pgfId-1065804]##With an understanding of
_SOAPSerializationState_ , we are prepared to look at the definition of
_SOAPSerializationContext_ :

[#50634753_pgfId-1066407]##package com.sun.xml.rpc.encoding.soap;

[#50634753_pgfId-1066395]##public class SOAPSerializationContext

[#50634753_pgfId-1066403]## implements
javax.xml.rpc.encoding.SerializationContext \{

[#50634753_pgfId-1065807]## // ...

[#50634753_pgfId-1065809]## public SOAPSerializationContext()

[#50634753_pgfId-1066400]## throws SerializationException \{...}

[#50634753_pgfId-1065810]## 

[#50634753_pgfId-1065811]## public SOAPSerializationContext(String
prefix)

[#50634753_pgfId-1065812]## throws SerializationException \{...}

[#50634753_pgfId-1066410]## 

[#50634753_pgfId-1065814]## public SOAPSerializationState
registerObject(Object obj,

[#50634753_pgfId-1065815]## SOAPSerializer serializer)

[#50634753_pgfId-1065816]## throws SerializationException \{...}

[#50634753_pgfId-1065817]## 

[#50634753_pgfId-1065818]## public SOAPSerializationState
lookupObject(Object obj)

[#50634753_pgfId-1065819]## throws SerializationException \{...}

[#50634753_pgfId-1065820]## 

[#50634753_pgfId-1065821]## public void
serializeTrailingBlocks(XMLWriter writer)

[#50634753_pgfId-1065822]## throws SerializationException \{...}

[#50634753_pgfId-1065824]##}

[#50634753_pgfId-1065826]##The _registerObject_ method is called by
serializers to add an object to the serialization context. References to
the object and its serializer are passed as parameters to
_registerObject_ , which generates a unique ID for the object and adds a
_SOAPSerializationState_ for the object to its internal map. If the
object has already been registered, _registerObject_ simply returns the
existing _SOAPSerializationState_ for the object.

[#50634753_pgfId-1065827]##The _lookupObject_ method is used by
serializers to determine if an object already exists in the
serialization context, and, if so, to gain access to the
_SOAPSerializationState_ for the object. If the object is unknown to the
serialization context, _lookupObject_ returns _null_ .

[#50634753_pgfId-1065828]##The _serializeTrailingBlocks_ method is
called at the end of the serialization process to serialize independent
elements (or trailing blocks) for each of the multi-reference objects
encountered during the serialization process.

===== [#50634753_pgfId-1065829]##SOAPSerializer Interface

[#50634753_pgfId-1065830]##All serializers implement the
_SOAPSerializer_ interface. The definition of the _SOAPSerializer_
interface is shown below:

[#50634753_pgfId-1066421]##package com.sun.xml.rpc.encoding.soap;

[#50634753_pgfId-1065832]##public interface SOAPSerializer

[#50634753_pgfId-1066426]## extends javax.xml.rpc.encoding.Serializer \{

[#50634753_pgfId-1065833]##

[#50634753_pgfId-1065837]## throws SerializationException;

[#50634753_pgfId-1065838]## 

[#50634753_pgfId-1065839]## void serializeInstance(Object obj, QName
name,

[#50634753_pgfId-1066467]## boolean isMultiRef,

[#50634753_pgfId-1065843]## 

[#50634753_pgfId-1065844]## void serialize(Object obj, QName name,

[#50634753_pgfId-1066640]## XMLWriter writer,

[#50634753_pgfId-1065845]## SOAPSerializationContext context)

[#50634753_pgfId-1065846]## throws SerializationException;

[#50634753_pgfId-1065848]##}

[#50634753_pgfId-1065852]##The _serializeReference_ method serializes a
_HREF_ to the passed-in object. The _obj_ parameter is a reference to
the object that is to be serialized. The _name_ parameter is the name to
be used for the XML element that represents the object. The _writer_
parameter is the _XMLWriter_ that should be used to write the XML
representation of the object. The _context_ parameter is the
_SOAPSerializationContext_ to be used during serialization of the
object. As an example, the following code would be used to serialize an
_HREF_ to an object (as opposed to serializing the object itself):

[#50634753_pgfId-1065854]## Address address = new Address("1234
Riverside Drive",

[#50634753_pgfId-1066699]## "Gainesville",

[#50634753_pgfId-1065855]## "Georgia", "30506");

[#50634753_pgfId-1065856]## XMLWriter writer = new XMLWriter(...);

[#50634753_pgfId-1065857]## SOAPSerializationContext serContext =

[#50634753_pgfId-1065858]## AddressSerializer addressSer = new
AddressSerializer(...);

[#50634753_pgfId-1065859]## addressSer.serializeReference(address,

[#50634753_pgfId-1066702]## new QName(null, "home-address"),

[#50634753_pgfId-1065884]## }

[#50634753_pgfId-1065885]##}

[#50634753_pgfId-1065887]##The _serializeInstance_ method serializes the
object instance itself (not an reference to it). The _obj_ parameter is
a reference to the object that is to be serialized. The _name_ parameter
is the name to be used for the XML element that represents the object.
The _isMultiRef_ parameter indicates whether the object is a
single-reference or a multiple-reference instance (multiple-reference
instances have an id attribute, single-reference instances do not). The
_writer_ parameter is the _XMLWriter_ that should be used to write the
XML representation of the object. The _context_ parameter is the
_SOAPSerializationContext_ to be used during serialization of the
object. As an example, the following code would be used to serialize a
multiple-reference object:

[#50634753_pgfId-1065889]## Address address = new Address("1234

[#50634753_pgfId-1065943]##The _serialize_ method of a serializer
performs "default" serialization of the passed-in object. Each
serializer is allowed to decide whether its data type should be
serialized as single-reference or multiple-reference instances by
default. If a serializer chooses single-reference to be the default,
then calling _serialize_ will have the same effect as calling
_serializeInstance_ with the _isMultiRef_ parameter set to false.
Alternatively, if a serializer chooses multiple-reference as its default
serialization mode, then calling _serialize_ will have the same effect
as calling _serializeReference_ . Of course, the code invoking a
serializer may choose to explicitly call _serializeReference_ or
_serializeInstance_ if it knows exactly how it wants to serialize the
object. However, in most cases it is best to let the serializer for a
particular data type decide how instances of that data type are
serialized by default.

======= [#50634753_pgfId-1065957]##Serializing Trailing Blocks

[#50634753_pgfId-1065958]##When a graph of Java objects is serialized,
references between objects are normally serialized as _HREFs_ by calling
the _serializeReference_ method (perhaps indirectly through _serialize_
). As the serialization process proceeds, the _SOAPSerializationContext_
creates a _SOAPSerializationState_ for each object that is referenced.
In addition to the object’s unique ID, the _SOAPSerializationState_
stores a reference to the object’s serializer, which is determined when
the first reference to the object is serialized. In addition to storing
a map from object references to _SOAPSerializationStates_ , the
_SOAPSerializationContext_ also stores a list of objects that have been
referenced during serialization but have yet to be serialized themselves
(i.e., a list of multiple-reference objects). After explicitly invoking
the serializers for each root of an object graph, it is necessary to
call the _serializeTrailingBlocks_ method on the
_SOAPSerializationContext_ in order to finish serializing all of the
objects that have been referenced but not yet serialized. The
_serializeTrailingBlocks_ method proceeds by serializing each
multiple-reference object in the list as a top-level independent element
with its id attribute set to the appropriate value. Of course, each
multiple-reference object may in turn contain references to other
objects, which means that the list of objects that need to be serialized
can grow even as _serializeTrailingBlocks_ proceeds; it simply continues
until the list is empty, at which point the object graph has been
completely serialized.

===== [#50634753_pgfId-1065959]##Primitive Serializers

[#50634753_pgfId-1065960]##The serialization framework as described thus
far can only handle Java types that are subtypes of java.lang.Object. Of
course, primitive types play a very important role and must also be
serialized. The JAX-RPC RI also includes serializers for all of the
primitive Java data types such as int, float, etc. These primitive
serializers are much simpler than the object serializers because they
don’t have to deal with _HREFs_ or nulls. Each primitive serializer has
a single method of the following form:

[#50634753_pgfId-1065962]##public void serialize(TYPE value, QName name,

[#50634753_pgfId-1066811]## XMLWriter writer)

[#50634753_pgfId-1065963]## throws SerializationException;

[#50634753_pgfId-1065964]## 

[#50634753_pgfId-1065965]##where _TYPE_ is a primitive type such as int,
float, etc. The serialize method simply writes the XML representation
for the primitive value to the _XMLWriter_ .

Deserialization

[#50634753_pgfId-1065967]##A deserializer is a class that knows how to
recreate instances of a particular Java type that have been serialized
using SOAP encoding. When a client of the serialization framework (e.g.,
a tie) needs to deserialize an object, it obtains a reference to a
deserializer for the object’s type and invokes the _deserialize_ method
on it, passing as parameters the _XMLReader_ that contains the SOAP
encoded XML representation of the object and a
_SOAPDeserializationContext_ . The _deserialize_ method reconstructs the
object from the XML representation and returns a reference to the object
as its result. Deserializing an object involves the following steps:

[#50634753_pgfId-1065968]##Open the XML element that represents the
object

[#50634753_pgfId-1066841]##Recursively deserialize each of the object’s
members which are encoded as sub-elements

[#50634753_pgfId-1066844]##Create a new instance of the Java type,
initializing it with the deserialized members

[#50634753_pgfId-1066847]##Return the new object as the result of
_deserialize_

[#50634753_pgfId-1065972]##Each member is deserialized by invoking the
_deserialize_ method on an appropriate deserializer, passing in the same
_XMLReader_ and _SOAPDeserializationContext_ that was used to
deserialize the parent object.

[#50634753_pgfId-1065973]##The deserialization problem is made
significantly more complex by the _HREF_ mechanism supported by SOAP
encoding. Ideally, whenever the _deserialize_ method is called, the
deserializer would be able to completely instantiate and initialize the
object being deserialized and return it as the result of _deserialize_ .
Unfortunately, if the SOAP encoded representation of the object contains
_HREF_ s to other objects, _deserialize_ will not be able to fully
reconstitute the object if member objects to which it refers have not
been deserialized yet. Only when all member objects have been
deserialized will it be possible to finish deserializing the parent
object, and this condition might not be satisfied until much later in
the deserialization process. For this reason, the serialization
framework allows the _deserialize_ method to only partially deserialize
an object, and then register listeners that allow it to be notified
later when its incomplete member objects become available, thus allowing
it to complete deserialization of the parent object. The details of
these mechanisms are provided in the following sections.

===== [#50634753_pgfId-1065974]##Deserializers

[#50634753_pgfId-1065975]##A deserializer is a Java class with the
following characteristics:

[#50634753_pgfId-1065976]##A deserializer must implement the
_SOAPDeserializer_ interface

[#50634753_pgfId-1065977]##A deserializer must be stateless. This allows
the JAX-RPC runtime to create and reuse a single deserializer instance
for each XML Schema data type in the system, thus minimizing the number
of deserializer objects that are created. Alternatively, a deserializer
may store immutable state that is initialized when the deserializer
instance is constructed.

[#50634753_pgfId-1065978]##A deserializer must be multi-thread safe,
thus allowing the JAX-RPC runtime to use a single deserializer instance
across multiple threads simultaneously.

[#50634753_pgfId-1065980]##All deserializers implement the
_SOAPDeserializer_ interface. The definition of _SOAPDeserializer_ is
shown below:

[#50634753_pgfId-1066853]##package com.sun.xml.rpc.encoding.soap;

[#50634753_pgfId-1065982]##public interface SOAPDeserializer

[#50634753_pgfId-1066858]## extends javax.xml.rpc.encoding.Deserializer
\{

[#50634753_pgfId-1065984]## Object deserialize(QName name, XMLReader
reader,

[#50634753_pgfId-1065985]## SOAPDeserializationContext context)

[#50634753_pgfId-1065986]## throws DeserializationException;

[#50634753_pgfId-1065987]## 

[#50634753_pgfId-1065988]##}

[#50634753_pgfId-1065990]##The _deserialize_ method is called to
deserialize an object. The _name_ parameter is the expected name of the
XML element that contains the object. If the actual element name does
not match the expected element name, _deserialize_ will throw an
exception. The _reader_ parameter contains the SOAP encoded XML data
that is to be deserialized. The _context_ parameter contains information
that must be shared among and passed between the deserializers that
participate in the deserialization of an object graph. As an object
graph is deserialized, the same _SOAPDeserializationContext_ instance is
passed to each deserializer that participates. If all goes well,
_deserialize_ will return a reference to a completely deserialized Java
object. As explained in the next section, this might not always be the
case.

===== [#50634753_pgfId-1065991]##SOAPDeserializationContext

[#50634753_pgfId-1065992]##The _SOAPDeserializationContext_ class stores
information that is necessary to properly reconstruct object graphs that
make use of the SOAP encoding _HREF_ mechanism. Specifically, it stores
a _SOAPDeserializationState_ object for each object encountered during
the deserialization process that cannot be completely deserialized by
its deserializer’s _deserialize_ method. Ideally, when the _deserialize_
method is done, it returns a reference to the object that it was asked
to deserialize. However, there are two scenarios in which deserialize is
unable to completely deserialize the object:

[#50634753_pgfId-1065993]##The deserializer has been asked to
deserialize an _HREF_ to the object, and the object itself has not been
completely deserialized yet

[#50634753_pgfId-1065994]##The object being deserialized contains
references (either directly or indirectly) to other objects which have
not yet been completely deserialized

[#50634753_pgfId-1065995]##In these cases, instead of returning a
reference to the object itself, it returns a reference to the
_SOAPDeserializationState_ for the object. The
_SOAPDeserializationState_ returned by _deserialize_ will have been
registered with the _SOAPDeserialization Context_ so that it can be
accessed by other deserializers that participate in deserialization of
the object graph.

[#50634753_pgfId-1066961]## _SOAPDeserializationState_ stores several
pieces of information that track the progress of an object as it is
being deserialized:

[#50634753_pgfId-1065997]##A reference to the object, which is _null_ if
it has not yet been instantiated

[#50634753_pgfId-1065998]##The current state of the object: _None_ ,
_Created_ , _Initialized_ , _Complete_ (more on this later)

[#50634753_pgfId-1065999]##Information about other objects that this
object depends on

[#50634753_pgfId-1066000]##Information about other objects that depend
on this object

[#50634753_pgfId-1066001]##A reference to the deserializer for this
object.

[#50634753_pgfId-1066002]##A reference to the _SOAPInstanceBuilder_ for
this object (more on this later)

[#50634753_pgfId-1066003]##A partial definition of
_SOAPDeserializtionState_ is shown below:

[#50634753_pgfId-1066874]##package com.sun.xml.rpc.encoding.soap;

[#50634753_pgfId-1066005]##public class SOAPDeserializationState \{

[#50634753_pgfId-1066006]## // ...

[#50634753_pgfId-1066018]## public void setDeserializer(SOAPDeserializer
deserializer)

[#50634753_pgfId-1066024]## public void setBuilder(SOAPInstanceBuilder
builder)\{...}

[#50634753_pgfId-1066026]## // ...

[#50634753_pgfId-1066027]##}

[#50634753_pgfId-1066029]##The _setInstance_ method is called by a
deserializer when the object that is being deserialized is instantiated
(i.e., when "new" is called). The object need not have been completely
deserialized in order to call _setInstance_ ; it only needs to have been
constructed. The _getInstance_ method can be used by deserializers to
obtain a reference to the object during the deserialization process.

[#50634753_pgfId-1066030]##The _isComplete_ method can be called to
determine whether or not the object has been completely deserialized
yet.

[#50634753_pgfId-1066031]##The _doneReading_ method is called by an
object’s deserializer to notify the serialization framework that it is
finished deserializing the object’s data members. This does not imply
that the object is entirely complete because it may still have
unresolved dependencies on other objects. It does mean, however, that
the XML element representing the object has been completely processed.

[#50634753_pgfId-1066032]##The _setDeserializer_ method is called to
tell the serialization framework which deserializer to use for this
object. This information is required by the framework when it comes time
to deserialize the trailing blocks that represent multiple-reference
objects.

[#50634753_pgfId-1066033]##The _registerListener_ method is used by the
deserializer of a parent object to declare a dependency on a member
object that has not yet been completely deserialized (and is thus
unavailable), and to request that it be notified as the deserialization
of the member object progresses. Specifically, the deserializer for the
parent object calls _registerListener_ on the _SOAPDeserializationState_
for the member object, passing as parameters a reference to the parent’s
_SOAPDeserializationState_ and an index that uniquely identifies the
member within the parent. This call sets up the necessary callback
relationship that allows the parent deserializer to be notified when the
member object has been completely deserialized, thus allowing it to
complete serialization of the parent object.

[#50634753_pgfId-1066034]##The _setBuilder_ method is described later in
this section.

[#50634753_pgfId-1066035]##With this understanding of
_SOAPDeserializationState_ , we are ready to look at the definition of
_SOAPDeserializationContext_ :

[#50634753_pgfId-1066037]##public class SOAPDeserializationContext

[#50634753_pgfId-1066968]## implements
javax.xml.rpc.encoding.DeserializationContext \{

[#50634753_pgfId-1066038]## // ...

[#50634753_pgfId-1066040]## public SOAPDeserializationContext()

[#50634753_pgfId-1066981]## throws DeserializationException \{...}

[#50634753_pgfId-1066043]## public SOAPDeserializationState
getStateFor(String id) \{...}

[#50634753_pgfId-1066991]## 

[#50634753_pgfId-1066045]## public void
deserializeRemainingElements(XMLReader reader)

[#50634753_pgfId-1066046]## throws DeserializationException \{...}

[#50634753_pgfId-1066048]##}

[#50634753_pgfId-1066050]##The _getStateFor_ method is used to obtain a
reference to the _SOAPDeserialization State_ for the object with a
particular ID. The first time the state for a particular ID is
requested, the context creates a new _SOAPDeserializationState_ for that
object and adds it to the internal state map.

[#50634753_pgfId-1066051]##The _deserializeRemainingElements_ method is
called at the end of the deserialization process to deserialize the
independent elements (or trailing blocks) that represent the
multiple-reference objects.

===== [#50634753_pgfId-1066052]##The deserialize Method

[#50634753_pgfId-1066053]##The workhorse of the deserialization process
is the _deserialize_ method. The deserializer for each Java type
implements _deserialize_ in a way that is appropriate for that type. For
example, the deserializer for a JavaBean would deserialize each of the
bean’s properties, set these properties on a new instance of the bean,
and return the new bean instance as the result of the _deserialize_
method.

[#50634753_pgfId-1066054]##As has been mentioned previously, the ideal
case occurs when _deserialize_ is able to instantiate and completely
initialize the object, thus allowing it to return the object itself as
the result. However, in those cases where the object cannot be
completely deserialized, the _deserialize_ method returns the
_SOAPDeserializationState_ for the object instead of the object itself.
This allows whoever called _deserialize_ (usually the deserializer of a
parent object), to register for events that will allow it to eventually
complete its deserialization. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the
code that calls _deserialize_ to check the return value to determine
whether it’s the object itself or the _SOAPDeserializationState_ that
represents the incompletely deserialized object (this check is performed
using Java’s _instanceof_ operator).

[#50634753_pgfId-1066055]##When the _deserialize_ method completes, the
object being deserialized can be in one of four states. The first state
occurs when the deserializer was able to completely deserialize the
object, in which case the object is referred to as being _COMPLETE_ . In
the other three states, the object has dependencies on at least one
member object that is not yet completely deserialized, thus preventing
the complete deserialization of the parent object. The first incomplete
state occurs when at least one of the incomplete member objects is
required as a constructor parameter for the parent object, thus
preventing the deserializer from instantiating the parent object until
the member is complete; this state is referred to as _NONE_ . The second
incomplete state occurs when the deserializer is able to instantiate the
object by calling "new", but it is not able to completely initialize the
other members of the object due to one or more incomplete member
objects; this state is referred to as _CREATED_ . The third incomplete
state occurs when the deserializer is able to instantiate the object and
initialize all of its members, but at least one of the object’s members
is still not entirely complete (although it has been instantiated); this
state is referred to as _INITIALIZED_ . If the object is _COMPLETE_ ,
_deserialize_ returns the actual object as its return value. If the
object is _NONE_ , _CREATED_ , or _INITIALIZED_ , _deserialize_ returns
the object’s _SOAPDeserializationState_ as its return value.

[#50634753_pgfId-1066056]##Pseudo-code for a deserializer’s

[#50634753_pgfId-1066157]##This pseudo-code demonstrates the logic of
the _deserialize_ method, but it does not impose a particular
implementation on deserializers. Although the algorithm looks
complicated, it is actually quite simple to write deserializers for many
Java types, especially those that have no-argument constructors (e.g.,
structures and arrays). It is also possible to write generic
deserializers that can handle entire classes of types such as arrays and
JavaBeans. In addition, much of the code for serializers can be placed
in library base classes, greatly simplifying development of new
serializers.

===== [#50634753_pgfId-1066158]##Instance Builders

[#50634753_pgfId-1066159]##When a deserializer is unable to completely
deserialize an object, it must do two things:

[#50634753_pgfId-1066160]##Register the _SOAPDeserializationState_ for
the parent object as a listener with the _SOAPDeserializationState_ of
the incomplete member object. This allows the deserializer to be
notified of progress made in the deserialization of the member object.

[#50634753_pgfId-1067119]##The deserializer needs to remember any state
that it accumulated during _deserialize_ that it will need later to
finish deserializing the parent object when the member object is
complete. For example, it might need to remember the values of some
members that were completely deserialized during the call to
_deserialize_ and will be needed later to complete initialization of the
object.

[#50634753_pgfId-1066162]##The problem with (2) is that we have assumed
that deserializers are stateless and are thus incapable of storing state
that will be needed later to complete deserialization of the object when
its members are complete. Instance builders are the mechanism used to
overcome the limitations on stateless deserializers. In effect, instance
builders allow deserializers to become stateful when they need to. When
a deserializer is only able to partially deserialize an object, it
creates an instance builder and stores a reference to it in the object’s
_SOAPDeserializationState_ . The instance builder is initialized to
store any state that the deserializer will need later to complete the
task of deserializing the object once its members have been
deserialized.

[#50634753_pgfId-1066163]##In addition to storing state, instance
builders are actually responsible for completing deserialization of the
parent object (thus the name "instance builder"). The serialization
framework will notify the instance builder when deserialization of its
members has progressed to the point that it should be able to construct
the parent object and complete its initialization. Therefore, the
instance builder is really an extension of the stateless deserializer
that originally began deserializing of the parent object.

[#50634753_pgfId-1066164]##An instance builder is a Java class that
implements the _SOAPInstanceBuilder_ interface. The definition of this
interface is:

[#50634753_pgfId-1067121]##package com.sun.xml.rpc.encoding.soap;

[#50634753_pgfId-1066166]##public interface SOAPInstanceBuilder \{

[#50634753_pgfId-1066168]## int memberGateType(int memberIndex);

[#50634753_pgfId-1066170]## void setMember(int index, Object
memberValue);

[#50634753_pgfId-1066172]## void construct();

[#50634753_pgfId-1066174]## void initialize();

[#50634753_pgfId-1066176]## void setInstance(Object instance);

[#50634753_pgfId-1066178]## Object getInstance();

[#50634753_pgfId-1066180]##}

[#50634753_pgfId-1066182]##The _memberGateType_ method is called by the
serialization framework to query the instance builder about the types of
dependencies it has on incomplete member objects. The value returned by
this method for a particular member tells the framework what the
instance builder needs that member for (construction or initialization),
and how complete the member must be before the instance builder can make
use of it (created, initialized, or complete). This information allows
the framework to determine when deserialization has progressed far
enough that the instance builder should be able to instantiate or
initialize the object.

[#50634753_pgfId-1066183]##The _setMember_ method is called by the
framework to notify the instance builder whenever one of its member
objects has been instantiated (it still might not be entirely complete,
but at least it’s been instantiated).

[#50634753_pgfId-1066184]##The _construct_ method is called by the
framework when all members needed for construction are ready, thus
allowing the instance builder to instantiate the object.

[#50634753_pgfId-1066185]##The _initialize_ method is called by the
framework when all members needed to complete initialization of the
object are ready.

[#50634753_pgfId-1066186]##The _setInstance_ method is called to provide
the instance builder with a reference to the object, which is useful
when the object was instantiated by the deserializer before the instance
builder was created (e.g., during _deserialize_ ).

[#50634753_pgfId-1066187]##The _getInstance_ method is called by the
framework to get a reference to the object after it has been
instantiated by the instance builder (e.g., after a call to _initialize_
).

===== [#50634753_pgfId-1066188]##Deserializing Trailing Blocks

[#50634753_pgfId-1066189]##In order to completely deserialize an object
graph, it is necessary to explicitly invoke the deserializer for each
root of the graph in the same order that the roots were originally
serialized. After doing this, it is also necessary to call the
_deserializeRemainingElements_ method on the
_SOAPDeserializationContext_ to complete deserialization of the trailing
blocks that represent multiple-reference objects.

[#50634753_pgfId-1066190]##For example, the code required to deserialize
this SOAP encoded object graph:

[#50634753_pgfId-1066192]##<home-address href="#ID-1"/>

[#50634753_pgfId-1066193]##<tns:Address xsi:type="tns:Address"
id="ID-1">

[#50634753_pgfId-1066194]## <street href="#ID-2"/>

[#50634753_pgfId-1066195]## <city href="#ID-3"/>

[#50634753_pgfId-1066196]## <state href="#ID-4"/>

[#50634753_pgfId-1066197]## <zip href="#ID-5"/>

[#50634753_pgfId-1066198]##</tns:Address>

===== [#50634753_pgfId-1066220]##Primitive Deserializers

[#50634753_pgfId-1066221]##Just as for serialization, deserialization of
primitive Java types are handled by a separate framework because they
are not subtypes of _java.lang.Object_ . The JAX-RPC RI also includes
deserializers for all of the primitive Java data types such as int,
float, etc. These primitive deserializers are much simpler than the
object deserializers because they don’t have to deal with _HREF_ s or
nulls. Each primitive deserializer has a single method of the following
form:

[#50634753_pgfId-1066223]##public TYPE deserialize(QName name, XMLReader
reader)

[#50634753_pgfId-1066224]## throws DeserializationException;

[#50634753_pgfId-1065748]##where _TYPE_ is a primitive type such as int,
float, etc.

[#50634753_88105]##Appendix: Mapping of XML Names

image:jaxrpc-4.gif[image]

[#50634753_pgfId-1017092]##Note that this section has been taken from
the JAXB (Java APIs for XML data binding)
link:jaxrpc.htm#50634753_99925[See JAXB specification:
http://java.sun.com/xml/jaxb/] specification. There are some minor
changes and clarifications.

[#50634753_pgfId-1017313]##XML schema languages use XML names. The
character set supported in the XML name is much larger than the
character set defined for valid identifiers for Java class, interface
and method.

[#50634753_pgfId-1017307]##This chapter defines recommended mapping of
XML names to Java identifiers in a way that adheres to the standard Java
API design guidelines, generates identifiers that retain mapping from
the source schema and is unlikely to result in collisions.

Mapping

[#50634753_pgfId-1017312]##Java identifiers are based on the following
conventions:

[#50634753_pgfId-1017101]##Class and interface names always begin with
an upper-case letter. The remaining characters are either digits,
lower-case letters or upper-case letters. Upper-case letters within a
multi-word name serve to identify the start of each non-initial word or
sometimes to stand for acronyms. These names may contain an ‘_’
underscore.

[#50634753_pgfId-1017106]##Method names always begin with a lower-case
letter, and otherwise are exactly like class and interface names.

[#50634753_pgfId-1017109]##Constant names are entirely in upper case,
with each pair of words separated by the underscore character _(’_’,
\u005F, LOW LINE)_ .

[#50634753_pgfId-1017413]##XML names are much richer than Java
identifiers: They may include not only the standard Java identifier
characters but also various punctuation and special characters that are
not permitted in Java identifiers. Like most Java identifiers, most XML
names are in practice composed of more than one natural-language word.
Non-initial words within an XML name typically start with an upper-case
letter followed by a lower-case letter (as in Java) or are prefixed by
punctuation characters (not usual in Java and for most punctuation
characters are in fact illegal).

[#50634753_pgfId-1017355]##In order to map an arbitrary XML name into a
Java class, method, or constant identifier, the XML name is first broken
into a word list. For the purpose of constructing word lists from XML
names, the following definitions are used:

[#50634753_pgfId-1017122]##A _punctuation_ _character_ ( _punct_ ) is
one of the following:

[#50634753_pgfId-1017124]## _Hyphen (’-’, \u002D, HYPHEN-MINUS)_

[#50634753_pgfId-1017126]## _Period (’.’, \u002E, FULL STOP)_

[#50634753_pgfId-1017128]## _Colon (’:’, \u003A, COLON)_

[#50634753_pgfId-1017132]## _Dot (’•’, \u00B7, MIDDLE DOT)_

[#50634753_pgfId-1017072]## _\u0387, GREEK ANO TELEIA_

[#50634753_pgfId-1017147]## _\u06DD, ARABIC END OF AYAH_

[#50634753_pgfId-1017149]## _\u06DE, ARABIC START OF RUB EL HIZB_

[#50634753_pgfId-1017382]##These are all legal characters in XML names.

[#50634753_pgfId-1017152]##A _letter_ is a character for which the
method _Character.isLetter_ returns _true_ ; identifying a letter based
on the Unicode standard. Every letter is a legal Java identifier
character, both initial and non-initial.

[#50634753_pgfId-1017156]##A _digit_ is a character for which the method
_Character.isDigit_ returns _true_ , identifying a digit according to
the Unicode Standard. Every digit is a legal non-initial Java identifier
character.

[#50634753_pgfId-1017160]##A _mark_ is a character that is in none of
the previous categories but for which the method
_Character.isJavaIdentifierPart_ returns _true_ . This category includes
numeric letters, combining marks, non-spacing marks, and ignorable
control characters.

[#50634753_pgfId-1017164]##Every XML name character falls into one of
the above categories. Letters are further divided into sub-categories:

[#50634753_pgfId-1017167]##An _upper-case_ _letter_ is a letter for
which the method _Character.isUpperCase_ returns _true_

[#50634753_pgfId-1017170]##A _lower-case_ _letter_ is a letter for which
the method _Character.isLowerCase_ returns _true_

[#50634753_pgfId-1017173]##All other letters are uncased.

[#50634753_pgfId-1017174]##An XML name is split into a word list by
removing any leading and trailing punctuation characters and then
searching for word breaks. A word _break_ is defined by three regular
expressions: A prefix, a separator, and a suffix. The prefix matches
part of the word that precedes the break, the separator is not part of
any word, and the suffix matches part of the word that follows the
break. The word breaks are defined as:

======= [#50634753_pgfId-1017844]## 

[#50634753_pgfId-1017852]##Prefix

[#50634753_pgfId-1017835]##The character \u2160 is ROMAN NUMERAL ONE, a
numeric letter.

[#50634753_pgfId-1025442]##After splitting, if a word begins with a
lower-case character then its first character is converted to an upper
case. The final result is a word list in which each word is one of the
following:

[#50634753_pgfId-1017225]##A string of upper- and lower-case letters,
the first character of which is upper case

[#50634753_pgfId-1017228]##A string of digits

[#50634753_pgfId-1017230]##A string of uncased letters and marks

[#50634753_pgfId-1017231]##Given an XML name in a word-list form, Java
identifiers are mapped as follows:

[#50634753_pgfId-1017234]##A class or interface identifier is
constructed by concatenating the words in the list

[#50634753_pgfId-1017237]##A method identifier is constructed by
concatenating the words in the list.

[#50634753_pgfId-1017238]##A prefix verb (example: get, set, is) is
prepended to the result or if no prefix is required, the first character
is converted to lower case.

[#50634753_pgfId-1017243]##This mapping does not change an XML name that
is already a legal and conventional Java class, method, or constant
identifier, except perhaps to add an initial verb in the case of a
property access method.

Changes for the JAX-RPC 1.1 Maintenance Release

[#50634753_pgfId-1116641]##Section 8.2.5: Added
ServiceFactory.loadService(Class) method and a requirement on
implementations so that applications can use it reliably and not depend
on any particular implementation being used (modulo
packaging/configuration, that is).

[#50634753_pgfId-1116566]##Section 14.4: Updated this section to align
it with the WS-I BP 1.0 Board Approval Draft. Detailed changes are:
added R2028, R2029, R4003, R2754 to 14.4.1; added R2114 to 14.4.2; added
R1141, R1132, R2250 to 14.4.3; moved R1125, R1113, R1114, R1115, R1130
from the second to the third group in 14.4.3.

[#50634753_pgfId-1111959]##Section 4.2.4: Added “the enclosing
xsd:attribute” as a basis for creating a name for the class
corresponding to an anonymous enumeration type. Added a new clause
requiring implementations to support, in addition to the default
mapping, a JAXB-compatible mapping that treats an anonymous enumeration
as a derivation by restriction. Also added an example for the anonymous
case.

[#50634753_pgfId-1112287]##Section 4.2.6: Changed the mapping of simple
types derived using xsd:list to use arrays instead of java.util.List
objects.

[#50634753_pgfId-1112012]##Section 4.2.1: Modified the provision about
“element declarations with nillable attribute set to true” to cover two
more cases: (a) element declarations with minOccurs=”0” and
maxOccurs=”1” or absent, and (b) attribute declarations with
use=”optional” or absent and not specifying a default or fixed value.

[#50634753_pgfId-1112134]##Section 4.2.3: Changed the name of the
property corresponding to the content of a complex type defined using
xsd:simpleContent to “_value”. Previously it was “value”.

[#50634753_pgfId-1112124]##Section 4.2.3: Changed the name of the
property corresponding to a wildcard to “_any”. Previously it was “any”.

[#50634753_pgfId-1112127]##Section 4.2.3: Changed the mapping of
wildcards (xsd:any) to javax.xml.soap.SOAPElement. Previously they were
mapped to java.lang.Object. Also added an example.

[#50634753_pgfId-1112268]##Section 14.3: Clarified that the
interoperability requirements inherited from JAX-RPC 1.0 have been
extended in this revision to include new ones motivated by the WS-I
Basic Profile 1.0.

[#50634753_pgfId-1112260]##Section 3.R01 and Chapter 14: Changed all
references to “an interoperable JAX-RPC implementation” to “a JAX-RPC
implementation”. Rationale: interoperability requirements are, quite
simply, requirements that all JAX-RPC implementations must satisfy.

[#50634753_pgfId-1112011]##Section 4.2.1: Removed note on
javax.xml.namespace.QName being “a placeholder”.

[#50634753_pgfId-1112316]##Section 4.2.1: Added table 4-2 to clarify the
mapping of the remaining built-in XSD simple types

[#50634753_pgfId-1111661]##Appendix 18: Specified that tools must be
able to handle the xsd:import and xsd:include schema constructs.

[#50634753_pgfId-1111524]##Section 4.3.12: Added name collision rules
for Java enumeration classes.

[#50634753_pgfId-1111386]##Section 4.3.12: Added name collision rules
for Java classes derived from an xsd:element.

[#50634753_pgfId-1111385]##Section 5.4.1: Added mapping of value types
to complex types that use the xsd:sequence compositor. Fixed the example
accordingly since it wasn’t valid according to the XML Schema
specification.

[#50634753_pgfId-1111067]##Section 5.3.3: Deprecated the mapping of
Byte[] to xsd:base64Binary.

[#50634753_pgfId-1111093]##Section 8.2.5: Added the two new
loadService() methods to javax.xml.rpc.ServiceFactory.

[#50634753_pgfId-1111066]##Section 14.4 (new): Added WS-I BP 1.0
interoperability requirements.

[#50634753_pgfId-1111009]##Section 14.3.6: Removed mapping to/from
tentative SOAP 1.2 fault codes.

[#50634753_pgfId-1110811]##Section 14.3.2: Removed literal
representation from 1.0 interop requirements section.

[#50634753_pgfId-1110847]##Section 12.1.4: Clarified that for one-way
operations only the handleRequest methods are called.

[#50634753_pgfId-1110438]##Section 10.1.2: Specified that, in the
servlet-based case, implementations must return a HTTP response code
before dispatching a one-way request to a servlet endpoint instance.

[#50634753_pgfId-1110290]##Section 5.5.5: Specified which Java methods
can be mapped to one-way operations.

[#50634753_pgfId-1110273]##Section 8.2.4.1: Added a requirement that, in
the case of SOAP/HTTP, invokeOneWay block until an HTTP response code
has been received from the server or an error occurs.

[#50634753_pgfId-1110241]##Section 5.5.5: Clarified that one-way
operations cannot have wsdl:output and wsdl:fault elements.

[#50634753_pgfId-1110240]##Section 6.6 (new): Specified mapping for
header faults.

[#50634753_pgfId-1111002]##Section 4.3.6: Specified mapping for literal
faults (whose message part uses the “element” attribute instead of
“type”).

[#50634753_pgfId-1110927]##Section 6.4: Added requirement to support
rpc/literal.

[#50634753_pgfId-1110183]##Section 6.4.3: Modified the example to make
the alternative mappings clearer.

[#50634753_pgfId-1110007]##Section 6.4.1: Restated the requirement
(already present in 1.0) to be able to unwrap document/literal calls as
its own form of mapping.

[#50634753_pgfId-1110006]##Section 6.2: Removed the description of
“wrappers” since it conflicts with the Basic Profile.

[#50634753_pgfId-1110291]##Javadocs only: Added prefix field, getPrefix
method and ternary constructor to the javax.xml.namespace.QName class.

[#50634753_pgfId-1110384]##Appendix 18: Specified some schema constructs
as truly optional, meaning that JAX-RPC tools don’t have to handle them
gracefully.

[#50634753_pgfId-1110387]##Appendix 18: Updated the schema support
matrix to mark the newly required features as required.

[#50634753_pgfId-1110005]##Section 6.4.1: Added the ability to map any
literal part to SOAPElement even in case it has a standard mapping in
JAX-RPC, so that external data binding frameworks can be plugged onto
JAX-RPC more easily.

[#50634753_pgfId-1109932]##Sections 5.1.3 and 5.3.2: Added
javax.xml.namespace.QName and java.net.URI to the standard Java classes
for which a predefined mapping exists.

[#50634753_pgfId-1111096]##Sections 4.2.3 and 4.2.4: Specified that for
anonymous types the name to be used for the corresponding Java type must
be derived from “the nearest enclosing xsd:element, xsd:simpleType or
xsd:complexType”.

[#50634753_pgfId-1111097]##Section 4.2.3: Specified mapping of xsd:any
in complex type definitions to java.lang.Object (or an array thereof if
maxOccurs is greater than 1).

[#50634753_pgfId-1109895]##Section 4.2.3: Specified that attributes on
complex types must be mapped to properties of the resulting JavaBean
class.

[#50634753_pgfId-1109894]##Section 4.2.3: Added mapping for complex
types defined using xsd:simpleContent and xsd:extension together.

[#50634753_pgfId-1109893]##Section 4.2.6 (new): Specified mapping for
simple types defined using xsd:list.

[#50634753_pgfId-1109892]##Section 4.2.5 (new): Specified mapping for
simple types derived by restriction.

[#50634753_pgfId-1110999]##Section 5.3.2: Added mapping for the
java.net.URI.

[#50634753_pgfId-1109891]##Section 4.2.1: Added mapping for the
remaining built-in XML Schema simple types for which JAXB 1.0 defines a
special mapping. Also, added a clause to explicitely excluded
xsd:NOTATION, xsd:ENTITY and xsd:IDREF.

[#50634753_pgfId-1109890]##Section 4.2.1: Added mapping for the
xsd:anyURI type to both java.net.URI (available in J2SE 1.4) and
java.lang.String (for compatibility with previous J2SE versions).

[#50634753_pgfId-1110993]##Section 13.1.1: Clarified that constants
defined on the Call and Stub interfaces can be used in lieu of the
corresponding strings for the
“javax.xml.rpc.security.auth.[username|password]” strings.

[#50634753_pgfId-1109889]##Section 10.1.3: Added isUserInRole method to
the ServletEndpointContext interface.

attachments only decoding is required.

[#50634753_pgfId-1109586]##Sections 4.2.3 and 5.3.4: Clarified that an
element with an attribute of the form maxOccurs=”1” should not result in
a array-valued property of a value type.

[#50634753_pgfId-1109585]##Section 4.2.3: Clarified that boolean
property in value types should follow the JavaBeans conventions, hence
use “is” instead of “get” as a prefix.

[#50634753_pgfId-1109584]##Section 4.3.11: Clarified name mapping for
the get<name_of_wsdl:port> methods.

[#50634753_pgfId-1110961]##Section 3 (R013): Required support for SAAJ
1.2.

[#50634753_pgfId-1109583]##Removed reference to the TCK in section 3
(R05).

[#50634753_pgfId-1110129]##Fixed the indentation of several XML
fragments.

[#50634753_pgfId-1110446]##Added a reference to the WS-I Basic Profile
